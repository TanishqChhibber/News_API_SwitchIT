            "summary": "Bitcoin could be heading into another extended consolidation phase, with short-term indicators suggesting a more bearish outlook, contrary to the broader crypto community’s view, according to the head of research at 10x Research.\nWhile many crypto analysts predict new Bitcoin (\nBTC\n) all-time highs by June, Markus Thielen\nsaid\nin an April 14 markets report that he is skeptical, pointing out that onchain data signals “more of a bear market environment than a bullish one.”\nShort-term indicators signal potential market top\nThielen said the Bitcoin stochastic oscillator — which compares a particular closing price to a range of prices over a specific period to determine momentum — shows patterns “more typical of a market top or late-cycle phase rather than the early stages of a new bull run.”\nBitcoin is trading at $83,810 at the time of publication. Source:\nCoinMarketCap\n“As a result, short-term signals are not aligning with longer-term indicators, highlighting the disconnect in the market outlook,” Thielen said.\n“Bitcoin is no longer a parabolic ‘Long-Only’ retail-driven market,” he added, explaining it now “demands a more sophisticated, finance-oriented approach.”\n“Bitcoin’s rally over the past year hasn’t been driven by typical ‘crypto-bro’ speculation but by long-term holders seeking diversification and adopting a buy-and-hold strategy,” Thielen said.\nOver the past 12 months, Bitcoin is up 32.80% and is trading at around $83,810 at the time of publication,\naccording\nto CoinMarketCap.\nBitcoin price action may repeat 2024 pattern\nThielen reiterated his stance that Bitcoin may consolidate for an extended period, much like it did in 2024.\n“Despite our cautious optimism, we view Bitcoin as trading within a broad range of $73,000 to $94,000, with a slight upward bias,” he said.\nIn March 2024, Bitcoin\nreached its then-all-time high of $73,679\nbefore entering a consolidation phase, swinging within a range of around $20,000 until Donald Trump won the US elections in November.\nRelated:\nBitcoin price recovery could be capped at $90K — Here’s why\nMany crypto analysts are eyeing June as the month when Bitcoin could surpass its current all-time high of $109,000, which it reached in January just before Trump’s inauguration.\nSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten told\nCointelegraph in early March\nthat “there’s more than 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year.”\nSharing a similar view, Bitcoin network\neconomist Timothy Peterson\nand Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts have also marked June as when Bitcoin could reach a new high.\n“It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June,” Peterson said.\nMeanwhile, Coutts said, “The market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge – potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out.”\nMagazine:\nRiskiest, most ‘addictive’ crypto game of 2025, PIXEL goes multi-game: Web3 Gamer\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

            "summary": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that privacy should be a top priority for developers, warning that assumptions about transparency and good intentions in global politics are overly optimistic.\nIn an April 14 blog post, Buterin\nargued\nthat privacy is essential to maintain individual freedom and protect against the growing power of governments and corporations. He criticized the idea that increased transparency is inherently beneficial, saying it relies on assumptions about human nature that are no longer valid.\nThese assumptions include believing that global political leadership is “generally well-intentioned and sane,” and that social culture continues to progress in a positive direction.” Both are proving to be increasingly untrue, Buterin argued.\nButerin claimed there was “no single major country for which the first assumption is broadly agreed to be true.” Furthermore, he wrote that cultural tolerance is “rapidly regressing,” which is reportedly demonstrable by an X post\nsearch\nfor “bullying is good.”\nButerin’s personal privacy issues\nButerin said that he found his lack of privacy unsettling at times. He added:\n“Every single action I take outside has some nonzero chance of unexpectedly becoming a public media story.”\nCovertly taken photos of Vitalik Buterin. Source:\nVitalik.eth\nWhile this may appear as a suggestion that privacy is an advantage only for those who venture outside the social norms, he highlighted that “you never know when you will become one of them.”\nButerin only expects the need for privacy to increase as technology develops further, with brain-computer interfaces potentially allowing automated systems to peer directly into our brains. Another issue is automated price gouging, with companies charging individuals as much as they expect them to be able to pay.\nRelated:\nMessaging apps are spying on you — Here’s how to stay safe in 2025\nThere is no privacy with government backdoors\nButerin also argued strongly against the idea of adding government backdoors to systems designed to protect privacy. He said such positions are common but inherently unstable.\nHe highlighted how, in the case of Know Your Customer data, “it’s not just the government, it’s also all kinds of corporate entities, of varying levels of quality” that can access private data. Instead, the information is handled and held by payment processors, banks, and other intermediaries.\nSimilarly, telecommunication companies can locate their users and have been found to illegally\nsell\nthis data. Buterin also raised concerns that individuals with access will always be incentivized to abuse it, and data banks can always be hacked. Lastly, a trustworthy government can change and become untrustworthy in the future, inheriting all the sensitive data. He concluded:\n“From the perspective of an individual, if data is taken from them, they have no way to tell if and how it will be abused in the future. By far the safest approach to handling large-scale data is to centrally collect as little of it as possible in the first place.“\nRelated:\nPrivacy will unlock blockchain’s business potential\nAuthorities have more data than ever\nButerin raised the issue of governments being able to access anything with a warrant “because that‘s the way that things have always worked.” He noted that this point of view fails to consider that historically, the amount of data available for obtaining through a warrant was far lower.\nHe said the traditionally available data would still be available even “if the strongest proposed forms of internet privacy were universally adopted.” He wrote that “in the 19ᵗʰ century, the average conversation happened once, via voice, and was never recorded by anyone.”\nButerin’s proposed solutions\nButerin suggested solutions based mainly on\nzero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs)\nbecause they allow for “fine-grained control of who can see what information.” ZK-proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow one party to prove a statement is true without revealing any additional information.\nOne such system is a ZK-proof-based proof of personhood that proves you are unique without revealing who you are. These systems rely on documents like passports or biometric data paired with decentralized systems.\nAnother solution suggested is the\nrecently launched privacy pools\n, which allow for regulatory-compliant Ether (\nETH\n) anonymization. Buterin also cited on-device anti-fraud scanning, checking incoming messages and identifying potential misinformation and scams.\nThese systems are proof of provenance services for physical items using a combination of blockchain and ZK-proof technology. They track various properties of an item throughout its manufacturing cycle, ensuring the user of its authenticity.\nThe post follows Buterin’s recent\nprivacy roadmap for Ethereum\n. In it, he highlighted the short-term changes to the base protocol and ecosystem needed to ensure better user privacy.\nMagazine:\nCypherpunk AI: Guide to uncensored, unbiased, anonymous AI in 2025",

            "summary": "Spot Bitcoin (\nBTC\n) exchange-traded funds saw a total of\n$872 million in net outflows\nbetween April 3 and April 10, causing traders to wonder if overall interest in Bitcoin is fading. The strong selling pressure began on April 3, as global trade tensions increased and fears of an economic recession grew. This trend is especially concerning after two days of spot Bitcoin ETF net flows below $2 million on April 11 and April 14.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs aggregate net flows, USD. Source: CoinGlass\nBitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable near $83,000 for the past five weeks, which further suggests weak interest from both buyers and sellers. On one hand, this lack of volatility could show that Bitcoin is becoming a more mature asset class. For example, several S&P 500 companies have dropped 40% or more from their all-time highs, while Bitcoin’s largest drawdown in 2025 was a healthier 32%.\nHowever, Bitcoin’s performance has disappointed those who believed in the\n“digital gold” narrative\n. Gold has gained 23% so far in 2025, reaching an all-time high of $3,245 on April 11. Even though Bitcoin outperformed the S&P 500 by 4% over the past 30 days, some investors worry that its appeal is fading, as it is currently uncorrelated with other assets and not acting as a reliable store of value.\nAverage Bitcoin ETF volume surpasses $2 billion per day\nWhen looking at the spot Bitcoin ETF market—especially compared to gold—Bitcoin has some advantages. On April 14, spot Bitcoin ETFs had a combined trading volume of $2.24 billion, which is 18% below the 30-day average of $2.75 billion. So, it would not be accurate to say that investor interest in these products has disappeared.\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs daily volumes, USD. Source: CoinGlass\nWhile Bitcoin ETF volumes are lower than the $54 billion per day traded by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), they are not far behind gold ETFs at $5.3 billion and are ahead of US Treasurys ETFs at $2.1 billion. This is impressive, considering that spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US only launched in January 2024, while gold ETFs have been trading for over 20 years and have $137 billion in assets under management.\nEven when including the Grayscale GBTC Trust, which surpassed 200,000 shares traded per day in 2017 before it was converted to an ETF, Bitcoin investment products are still less than eight years old. Currently, spot Bitcoin ETFs hold about $94.6 billion in assets under management, which is more than the market capitalization of well-known companies such as British American Tobacco, UBS, ICE, BNP Paribas, Cigna, Sumitomo Mitsui and several others.\nRelated:\nBitcoin shows growing strength during market downturn — Wintermute\nRanking of tradable assets by market capitalization, USD: Source: 8marketcap\nTo see how spot Bitcoin ETFs have become established in the industry, one can look at the top holders of these products. These include well-known names like Brevan Howard, D.E. Shaw, Apollo Management, Mubadala Investment, and the State of Wisconsin Investment. From pension funds to some of the world’s largest independent asset managers, Bitcoin ETFs provide an alternative to traditional assets, regardless of short-term price movements.\nAs the asset class grows and more products like\nfutures and options\nare listed, Bitcoin may eventually be included in global indexes, whether in the commodities or currencies category. This could lead passive funds to invest, increasing both price potential and trading volume. Therefore, the current lack of strong net inflows or outflows is not unusual and should not be seen as a sign of weakness.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

            "title": "Bitcoin death cross still present despite rally to $86K — Should BTC traders be afraid?",
            "summary": "On April 6, Bitcoin price formed a death cross on a daily chart — a technical pattern where the 50-day moving average (MA) falls below the 200-day MA. Historically associated with trend reversals and long bearish trading periods, this ominous signal has sometimes preceded major market drawdowns.\nThe latest death cross comes amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty. Equities are reeling from what appears to be the early stages of a tariff war, volatility is rising, and fear continues to dominate investor sentiment. For some investors, Bitcoin’s death cross could be the final blow to hopes of a near-term rally. Early signs of\ncapitulation\nfrom short-term holders may already be emerging.\nStill, not everyone sees doom ahead.\nBitcoin death crosses history\nBy definition, a death cross confirms the end of a bullish phase. When the 50-day MA drops below the 200-day MA, it suggests recent price action has weakened relative to the longer-term trend. Its counterpart, the golden cross, occurs when the opposite happens — often heralding a new rally.\nSince its inception, Bitcoin has experienced 10 such death crosses, with the 11th unfolding right now. Analyzing their dates and durations gives a major insight: every bear market included a death cross, but not every death cross has led to a bear market. This distinction is key to understanding the current setup.\nBTC/USD 1-day death cross history (log). Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingView\nIndeed, there are two types of death crosses: those that happen during bear markets and the rest. The three death crosses that formed during the bear markets of 2014-2015, 2018, and 2022 were long and painful. They lasted for 9 to 13 months and saw drawdowns between 55% and 68% from the day of the cross to the cycle bottom.\nThe remaining seven were far less severe. They lasted from 1.5 months to 3.5 months and saw Bitcoin decline anywhere from 27% to nothing at all. In many cases, these signals marked local bottoms and were followed by renewed rallies.\nThis brings us to the critical question: Is Bitcoin already in a bear market, or is this another bear trap?\nA bearish signal?\nIf Bitcoin is indeed in bear territory, as CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju\nbelieves\n, the current death cross could signal 6 to 12 more months of downward price action. This outlook aligns with his observations of the difference between the current market cap and the realized cap (average cost basis for each wallet x amount of BTC held).\n“If Realized Cap is growing, but Market Cap is stagnant or falling, it means capital is flowing in, but prices aren’t rising—a classic bearish signal.”\nCurrent data clearly points to the latter, Ki Young Ju adds.\n“Sell pressure could ease anytime, but historically, real reversals take at least six months—so a short-term rally seems unlikely.”\nBTC growth rate difference. Source: CryptoQuant\nOther market participants disregard the presence of the death cross. Crypto analyst Mister Crypto argued that the current death cross is a setup for a rally rather than a slide. “The trap is set again. This will be the most hated rally of 2025!” he\nposted\nalongside a chart showing previous false signals of this cycle.\nBitcoin death cross during the bull market. Source: Mister Crypto\nCoinShares head of research James Butterfill also downplayed the signal’s significance. As he\nput it\n,\n“For those of you that think the Bitcoin death cross means anything - empirically, it's total nonsense, and in fact, often a good buying opportunity.”\nButterfill’s data shows that, on average, Bitcoin prices are only slightly lower one month after a death cross (-3.2%) and often higher three months out.\nRelated:\nTrump tariffs reignite idea that Bitcoin could outlast US dollar\nInterestingly, Bitcoin isn’t the only asset flashing warning signs. The Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 are both on the verge of forming their own death crosses, while individual tech stocks — including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet — have already triggered them or are close to doing so.\nBitcoin’s recent move is part of a larger market reset, for better or for worse. At the moment, however, it leans more toward the \"worse\" side: as some analysts\npoint out\n, what’s bad for the Nasdaq tends to be bad for Bitcoin, too. Unless, of course, Bitcoin fully claims its role as\ndigital gold\n.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: X.com\nBitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr.\npointed\nout that Bitcoin’s cumulative net taker volume spiked to $800 million on April 11, hinting at a surge in aggressive buying. BTC price also jumped from $78,000 to $85,000 within three days, confirming previous historical patterns where high net take volume triggers price rallies.\nLikewise, Maartunn, a community analyst at CryptoQuant,\nconfirmed\nthat the current rally is a “leverage-driven pump.” The discrepancy arises because retail or spot traders are still not as relevant.\nBitcoin 30-day apparent demand. Source: CryptoQuant\nAs illustrated in the chart, Bitcoin apparent demand is on a recovery path, but it is not net positive yet. Historically, 30-day apparent demand can move sideways for a prolonged period after BTC reaches a local bottom, leading to a sideways chop for the crypto.\nThus, it is less likely that Bitcoin could breach $90,000 in the first attempt after dropping close to 20% until there is collective buying pressure from both spot and futures markets.\nLarge liquidation clusters between $80-$90K may bait traders\nWith futures traders positioning in either direction,\ndata\nfrom CoinGlass highlighted significant cumulative long and short liquidation leverage between $80,000 and $90,000. Taking $85,100 at the base price, total cumulative short positions at risk of liquidation are at $6.5 billion if BTC price hits $90,035.\nBitcoin exchange liquidation map. Source: CoinGlass\nOn the other hand, $4.86 billion in long orders will be wiped out if BTC drops to $80,071. While liquidation clusters do not determine directional bias, they can create long or short squeezes, baiting traders on either side of respective trades.\nWith such high capital at risk under $90,000, it is possible that Bitcoin may target each cluster before moving toward the dominant side.\nRelated: Bitcoin traders target $90K as apparent tariff exemptions ease US Treasury yields\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

            "summary": "Opinion by: Blake Cassidy, CEO of Bamboo\nCrypto podcasts have been newcomers’ go-to source of information, helping bring crypto into the mainstream. Podcasters must remember, however, that fresh faces are constantly tuning in as they grow.\nWhile you may say, “FOMO, buy the dip, ignore the FUD because WAGMI,” your poor listener — tuning in for the first time just trying to learn crypto — might decide learning Spanish is easier.\nPodcasters are more vital to crypto’s adoption rate than ever\nKeeping regular listeners engaged is important, but so is making sure newbies, who are only listening because they’re sick of hearing their mates brag about crypto at work, can follow along, too.\nYou can see this balance pulled off well in some of the\nbiggest crypto podcasts\nout there. Crypto podcasts that cater to the hodler and the novice enjoy dedicated followings and high view counts, whether the market is feeling bullish or bearish.\nSome worry that making things newbie-friendly will turn off industry professionals, but that’s not the case. Even the experts\nappreciate simplified content\n— it helps them stay on top of the week without digging through all the noise themselves.\nHow do you get that balance right? Work in the week’s biggest news, and it’ll appeal to everyone — whether they’re new to crypto or industry veterans. Even if it’s just a segment of your podcast, crypto enthusiasts at any level love having a go-to podcast that sums up the week before they’ve even had their morning coffee.\nCrypto’s accessibility problem\nAccessibility has always been one of crypto’s biggest hurdles. The tech,\nthe endless list of coins\n, even Web3-powered video games — many see it all as too complicated, unnecessary or just another scam. Some of these views represent a misunderstanding at best and outright ignorance at worst.\nOn the flip side, podcasters talk about quantum-resistant blockchains, unlimited transactions per second or Ethereum’s dreaded Surge,\nVerge, Purge and Splurge\nmalarky.\nThere is a delicate balance\nPodcasters can play a key role in moving blockchain solutions further into the mainstream by helping to overcome the high knowledge entry requirements we’ve seen previously.\nThere is a balance, however, as nobody wants to listen to an explainer podcast that feels like a weekly dictionary of crypto-bro jargon. The key is for podcasters to imagine they are in a room with a friend who knows nothing about crypto and someone who’s already clued in. Create content that works for both. If jargon is a must, which is often in this niche, a “here’s what we mean when we say this” now and then can go a long way to avoid alienating newcomers.\nNon-technical terms like “WAGMI” and “NGMI” should be spelled out instead of gatekeeping if we want to see retail swarm exchanges.\nMake it as easy as possible for the audience\nSeveral successful podcasts do a great job of providing timestamps in their podcast episodes, which often run longer than an hour. If an audience member can quickly understand what is included in the podcast and navigate to the sections most interesting to them, this will only strengthen engagement and loyalty.\nAdditionally, similes, analogies, metaphors and outright storytelling can help demystify some harder-to-grasp crypto concepts.\nThere are so many ways that podcasters can help rather than hinder the mainstream adoption of crypto. In any discipline, providing clear and concise information so that audiences can make more informed decisions is a responsibility — why should crypto podcasts be any different?\nOpinion by: Blake Cassidy, CEO of Bamboo.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

            "summary": "The recent collapse of the Mantra (OM) token triggered comparisons to the infamous Terra ecosystem crash in May 2022, with some commentators referring to Mantra as the “next Terra.” Still, many in the community argue that the two projects share nothing in common besides visual similarities in price charts.\n“While it’s tempting to draw parallels between OM’s recent crash and the Terra Luna collapse, they’re fundamentally very different events,” said Ben Yorke, vice president of ecosystem at the\ndecentralized finance (DeFi\n) project Woo, in a statement to Cointelegraph.\nAlexis Sirkia, chairman of the DeFi infrastructure project Yellow Network, agreed. “There are no real similarities apart from the visual of the price dropping,” he said.\nVisual similarity — different numbers\nMantra’s OM token\ndropped\n92% on April 13, dropping from over $6 to around $0.52 within hours. According to data from CoinGecko, OM lost $5.4 billion in market capitalization in less than four hours.\nBy contrast,\nTerraClassicUSD\n(formerly UST) took five days to\nlose\na similar percentage, shedding $17.2 billion.\nMantra’s OM crash in April 2025 versus USTC (formerly UST) crash in May 2022 (seven-day chart). Source: CoinGecko\nThe LUNA crash was more gradual than both the OM token and USTC. It started plummeting some time before the\nUST token depegged\non May 9, 2022.\nStill, the visual resemblance of the price charts has prompted comparisons among observers, despite significant structural differences between the projects.\nTerra collapse was systemic in contrast to Mantra\nWoo’s Yorke and Yellow Network’s Sirkia agreed that Terra’s collapse was systemic and occurred due to the failure of its\nalgorithmic stablecoin\n, while Mantra was not proven to be subject to any systemic flaws.\n“OM appears to be more of a case of mismanagement or negligence,” Yorke said, adding that the Mantra crash involved a “large number of insider-held tokens” moved to exchanges, which sparked cascading liquidations.\nSource:\nZachXBT\n“The issue wasn’t a structural flaw in the protocol, but rather a breakdown in token handling and trust,” he noted.\nRelated:\nMantra CEO says OM token recovery ‘primary concern’ but in early stages\n“Mantra is not broken. There was no peg to fail. This is a market structure issue, not a protocol failure,” Sirkia stated, stressing that only an event like a\nsmart contract\nfailure could indicate a serious issue in the protocol. He added:\n“Terra collapsed because of how it was built. Mantra went through a market-driven correction. The team remained transparent throughout. After the drop, OM bounced over 200%, showing real demand and community belief. That kind of recovery never happened with Luna.”\nYorke and Sirkia’s Mantra comments mark the second day after the OM crash, with the token slightly recovering to $0.80 by publishing time after a\nbrutal sell-off from above $6 to $0.50 per token\non April 13.\nAccording\nto the latest update by Mantra CEO John Mullin, Mantra expects to share a post-mortem report detailing the events leading to the crash of the OM token in the next 24 hours.\nMagazine:\nIllegal arcade disguised as … a fake Bitcoin mine?

            "title": "Crypto’s debanking problem persists despite new regulations",
            "summary": "The crypto industry’s inability to access banking services still concerns many industry observers despite recent policy victories.\nIn past years, financial services firms and banks concerned about fiduciary risk, reporting liabilities and reputational risk often would refuse to offer service to crypto firms — i.e., “debanking” them.\nLegislative efforts in the United States and Australia are attempting to remove these barriers for the crypto industry. In the former, legislators repealed guidelines that made it difficult for banks to custody crypto assets, as well as those stating that crypto carried “reputational risk” for banks. In the latter, the Labor Party has introduced a bill to create a legal framework for crypto, giving banks the clarity they need to interact with the crypto industry.\nDespite these tangible efforts, some crypto industry observers say that the crypto’s debanking problem is far from over.\nUS crypto execs say debanking is still an issue\nThe crypto industry has long decried “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” its nickname for a suite of policies that they claim constrained the crypto industry from growing under the administration of former President Joe Biden. Among these were measures making it more difficult for crypto firms to access banking services.\nThe early days of the second administration of President Donald Trump have seen many of these repealed or changed. One of the first was the\nrepeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121\n, which required banks offering custody for customers’ cryptocurrencies to list them as liabilities on their balance sheets — this made it very difficult for banks to justify offering such services.\nThe administration also appointed a new head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Rodney Hood. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Bitcoin-focused policy organization Satoshi Action, told Cointelegraph that under Hood’s tenure, the OCC has already said banks can offer crypto-related services like custody, stablecoin reserves and blockchain participation.\nRelated:\nAtkins becomes next SEC chair: What’s next for the crypto industry\n“This opens the door for broader adoption of digital asset technology and custodial services by traditional financial institutions, signaling a major shift in how banks engage with crypto,” he said.\nDespite these victories, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank,\nsaid on March 21\nthat debanking is likely to remain a problem for crypto firms into 2026.\nLong said the non-partisan board of governors of the Federal Reserve is “still controlled by Democrats,” alluding to Democrats’ more skeptical stance on crypto. Long claimed that “there are two crypto-friendly banks under examination by the Fed right now, and an army of examiners was sent into these banks, including the examiners from Washington, a literal army just smothering the banks.”\nLong noted that Trump won’t be able to appoint a new Fed governor until January, meaning that, while other agencies may be more crypto-friendly, there are still roadblocks.\nAustralia’s Labor Party to create crypto framework\nStand With Crypto, the “grassroots” crypto advocacy organization started by Coinbase that has spread to the US, UK, Canada and Australia,\nsaid\nthat “in Australia, debanking is quietly shutting out innovators and entrepreneurs — particularly in the crypto and blockchain space.”\nIn a\npost\non X, the organization claimed that debanking results in “reputational damage, loss of revenue, increased operational costs, and inability to launch or sustain services.” It also claimed that it forces some companies to move offshore.\nIn response to these concerns, the ruling center-left Labor Party in Australia has proposed a new set of laws for the cryptocurrency industry. The changes to current financial services law seek to tackle the issue of debanking in the country’s cryptocurrency industry.\nAustralia’s Treasury says its new crypto regulations have four priorities. Source:\nAustralian Department of the Treasury\nEdward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at MHC Digital Group — an Australian crypto platform — told Cointelegraph that in Australia, debanking decisions were “not the result of regulatory directives.”\n“Rather, they appear to stem from a more general sense of risk aversion due to the current lack of a clear regulatory framework.”\nRelated:\nUS gov’t actions give clue about upcoming crypto regulation\nCarroll was optimistic about the Labor Party’s proactive stance. The major political parties were “showing a shift in sentiment and a shared commitment to establishing formal crypto regulation.”\n“We are hopeful that this will give banks the confidence to reengage with crypto businesses that meet compliance standards,” he said.\nCanada unlikely to relieve crypto firms\nIn Canada, “debanking remains a serious and ongoing challenge for the Canadian crypto industry,” according to Morva Rohani, executive director of the Canadian Web3 Council.\n“While some firms have successfully established relationships with banking partners, many continue to face account closures or denials with little explanation or recourse,” she told Cointelegraph.\nWhile debanking actions aren’t explicit, financial institutions’ interpretation of Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer regulations “creates a risk-averse environment where banks weigh compliance and reputational concerns against the relatively low revenue potential of crypto clients.”\nThe end result, per Rohani, is a systemic debanking problem for the digital assets industry.\nBut unlike in the US and Australia, the Canadian crypto industry may not find relief anytime soon. Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose more crypto-skeptic Liberal Party is surging in the polls ahead of the April 28 snap elections, is himself a crypto-skeptic.\nPolls show Carney firmly in the lead. Source:\nIpsos\nCarney has\nstated\nthat the future of money lies more in a “central bank stablecoin,” otherwise referred to as a central bank digital currency.\nRohani said that “no comprehensive legislative solution has been implemented” with regard to debanking. “A more structured approach, including mandated disclosure of reasons for account termination and regulatory oversight, is needed,” she said.\nCritics claim crypto is “hijacking” the debanking issue\nThere is another side to the debanking debate, which claims that crypto’s debanking “problem” is a non-issue or a vehicle for crypto firms to get what they want in terms of regulation.\nMolly White, the author of\nWeb3 Is Going Just Great\nand the “Citation Needed” newsletter, has noted that, in the US at least, crypto firms have claimed to be victims of debanking while lauding Trump’s efforts to end protections for debanking at the same time.\nIn a Feb. 14 post, White\nstated\nthat the crypto industry had “hijacked” the discussion around debanking, which contains legitimate concerns regarding access to financial services — particularly regarding discrimination due to race, religious identity or industry affiliation.\nShe claims the crypto industry has used debanking as a means to deflect legitimate regulatory inquiries into crypto companies’ compliance efforts.\nFurther of note is the fact that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has applauded the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with Elon Musk at the helm, to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\nOne of the CFPB’s responsibilities is to investigate claims of debanking. But when DOGE\ninstructed\nthe agency to halt all work, Armstrong said it was “100% the right call,” in addition to making dubious claims about the agency’s constitutionality.\nIn the meantime\nWhether the industry’s debanking concerns stem from legitimate discrimination or an attempt at regulatory capture, crypto firms are developing solutions in the interim.\nPorter said that, as an alternative to banking services, “many crypto companies have leaned on stablecoins as a primary tool for managing finances,” while others have worked with “smaller regional banks or specialized trust companies open to digital assets.”\nRohani said that this kind of “patchwork of relationships” can increase operational costs and risks and are “not sustainable long-term solutions for growth or to build a competitive, regulated industry.”\nPorter concluded that the banking workarounds could actually strengthen the industry’s position, stating that they may “continue evolving into fully integrated relationships with traditional financial institutions, further cementing crypto’s place in mainstream finance.”\nMagazine:\nUK’s Orwellian AI murder prediction system, will AI take your job?

            "summary": "Introversion is often viewed in a light that contrasts with the traditional image of a high-powered entrepreneur: the loud, charismatic, networked go-getter who dominates boardrooms. For many introverts, this can seem like an obstacle. But what if we told you that some of the most successful business leaders in history—people like\nWarren Buffett\n—have built their empires with traits commonly associated with introversion?\nWarren Buffett, often referred to as the \"\nOracle of Omaha\n,\" has proven that quiet, thoughtful decision-making can be just as powerful, if not more so, than the loud, extroverted hustle. Over the years, Buffett has shared numerous pieces of wisdom that have helped shape the way many entrepreneurs approach business and life. What makes his advice even more special is that much of it aligns with the strengths and preferences of introverts.\nIn this article, we’ll dive into six pieces of advice from Warren Buffett that every introvert can implement to unlock their full potential and achieve success on their terms.\nWarren Buffett's introvert-friendly success tips\n1. Embrace the power of focused thinking\nIntroverts are often deep thinkers who excel at reflective, focused thought. This is one of the reasons why Buffett's first piece of advice aligns perfectly with an introverted mindset. In the world of business, there’s often pressure to keep up with the constant noise, trends, and the hustle of others. But Buffett has always emphasised the importance of\nfocus\nand\ndeep thinking\n.\nIn his own career, Buffett often retreats to a quiet space to think, read, and analyse. He believes that the best ideas often come from taking the time to think carefully, without distractions. For introverts, this natural inclination toward reflection and analysis is a strength, not a weakness. Use your ability to stay focused and develop deep insights into the problems you are trying to solve. Whether you're making decisions in business or navigating your personal life, Buffett suggests that the more you can engage in thoughtful, focused thinking, the better your chances of making informed, successful choices.\nKey takeaways:\nLeverage your ability to concentrate deeply.\nAllocate quiet time for reflection and strategic thinking.\nAvoid getting overwhelmed by external distractions.\n2. Be comfortable with saying no\nIntroverts are often naturally good at saying no—they tend to prioritise their time and energy carefully.\nWarren Buffett\nhas frequently spoken about the importance of saying no to opportunities and distractions that do not align with your values or long-term goals. In fact, he once said,\n“The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.”\nFor introverts, this advice can be liberating. Saying no is a way to protect your energy and focus on what truly matters. It’s easy to get caught up in commitments, meetings, or projects that may not bring value to your personal or professional growth. By honing the skill of saying no, introverts can stay focused on what is important and avoid burnout.\nKey takeaways:\nLearn to protect your time and energy.\nSay no to distractions and unnecessary commitments.\nFocus on what aligns with your goals and values.\n3. Work on your listening skills\nOne of Buffett’s signature strengths is his ability to listen. While many extroverts might dominate conversations, Buffett has always maintained that listening is a key part of success. For\nintroverts\n, listening comes naturally—they tend to observe and absorb information before speaking.\nBuffett believes that listening not only helps you gather critical information but also helps you build stronger, more meaningful relationships. Introverts often excel in this area because they tend to think before speaking, which can lead to more thoughtful, insightful contributions. By embracing your natural inclination to listen carefully, introverts can build trust, make better decisions, and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.\nKey takeaways:\nUse your natural listening abilities to build rapport.\nFocus on understanding others before offering your perspective.\nGain valuable insights that can inform your decision-making.\n4. Find your passion and pursue it relentlessly\nWarren Buffett has always emphasised the importance of doing what you love. This advice resonates deeply with introverts who may be less inclined to follow societal pressures and instead seek out work that aligns with their values and passions.\nFor introverts, finding a career or business venture that resonates deeply with your values can be a game-changer. When you’re passionate about something, your natural focus, determination, and quiet confidence will help you push through the inevitable challenges. Buffett himself is known for being deeply passionate about investing, and his success comes from his commitment to continuous learning and his love for the craft. Introverts can take this advice to heart—find what excites you, and relentlessly pursue it, regardless of whether it aligns with conventional expectations.\nKey takeaways:\nDiscover\nwhat you’re truly passionate about\n.\nPursue that passion with unwavering commitment.\nChannel your focus and quiet energy toward your interests.\n5. Make decisions based on sound judgment, not emotion\nBuffett is known for making decisions based on rational thinking rather than impulsive emotions. For introverts, this is a strength. Introverts tend to be more measured and less likely to make knee-jerk reactions or decisions driven by emotional impulses. This can be a huge advantage, especially in high-stress situations.\nBy using your analytical abilities and emotional control, introverts can make sound decisions in business and life. Warren Buffett’s approach to\ndecision-making\nis a testament to the importance of evaluating situations carefully, weighing the pros and cons, and sticking to long-term strategies. Introverts can excel in this area by taking the time to reflect, process information, and make well-considered decisions.\nKey takeaways:\nRely on logic and judgment, not emotion, when making decisions.\nAvoid impulsive reactions, especially in stressful moments.\nTake the time to evaluate and analyze before acting.\n6. Surround yourself with the right people\nWhile introverts may prefer solitude or small circles of trusted friends, Warren Buffett’s advice on\nsurrounding yourself with the right people\nis crucial. Introverts can thrive in a more intimate, supportive environment that values quality over quantity. Buffett stresses the importance of associating with individuals who challenge and support you, both personally and professionally.\nIntroverts can apply this advice by seeking out mentors, business partners, or friends who share similar values and goals. It’s not about building a vast network but about cultivating deep, meaningful relationships with people who add value to your life. This can be incredibly powerful for introverts, who often value authenticity and depth in their connections.\nKey takeaways:\nFocus on quality relationships rather than quantity.\nSurround yourself with people who support your vision.\nChoose mentors and collaborators who challenge you to grow.\nConclusion\nWarren Buffett's success is rooted in qualities that align well with the strengths of introverts—thoughtfulness, focus, and a methodical approach to decision-making. While introverts may not fit the traditional mold of a \"loud\" entrepreneur, they can leverage their natural abilities to thrive in business and life. By embracing Buffett's advice, introverts can carve their own paths to success, doing so in ways that resonate with their authentic selves.",

            "title": "From assistant to agent of change: how AI is reshaping the future of software development",
            "summary": "In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), how will the software development process and role of developers evolve? From ideation to implementation,\nAnupam Mishra\n, Director, Solution Architecture, AWS India, explored how AI, GenAI, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming every stage of software development, the trends shaping the field in 2025, and how these technologies can open up myriad of possibilities for developers in the future.\nSpeaking at DevSparks Pune, 2025, Mishra addressed the current environment of excitement and confusion amongst developers when it came to adoption of new technologies, such as AI, GenAI, and LLMs. The 20-minute keynote speech titled\n‘A view from the top: Introducing devs to the future of software\n’ covered topics such as AI-driven efficiency and enhanced development cycles. Mishra urged developers to actively leverage these technologies and turn them into superpowers - ones that could help them build smart, swift, and precise solutions in the future.\nAI: Buzzword or bogeyman?\nMishra opened the keynote with the statement, “An unprecedented change is coming to my profession.” For a long time, developers, he said, existed on two different ends of the spectrum when it came to AI. Some deemed it a hype cycle that would burn out eventually. Others regarded it with apprehension, worried about it taking jobs away. .\nHe addressed these thoughts and shared insights on what the future of AI development and adoption can potentially hold. “Nobody can predict that, but I think what we can do is be aware of what AI is, what it can do today, and how we stay relevant by keeping ourselves up to date on the latest technology, upskill, and apply it to address real-world challenges.”\nWith the swift rise of AI, he said we have seen new ways to use GenAI for building solutions. This is opening up a lot of possibilities for developers. However with the emergence of several genAI tools for developers at the same time, there is confusion amongst developers who are writing code every day. “Which tools should I use? Should I change the way I work? Should I do something different? Should I be doing sprint planning in a different way?”\nMishra stated that similar changes have happened in the past, citing how the evolution of machines aided by easing the workload and increasing efficiency. He shared that while anxiety around new technologies is normal, it is important for developers to stay aware and leverage the latest advancements.\nFrom assistant to agent: the evolution of AI\nMishra defined the current age as an AI-assisted era. Developers are using AI as an assistant for a range of tasks, such as writing test cases, generating documentation, conducting code reviews, and much more. These capabilities are only getting better day by day.\nHe shared the example of Amazon Q developer, which can help developers with AI-assisted coding. “You can say, ‘my code is in Java 8. Can you upgrade it to Java 17?’ - and it will upgrade it. . This is not interesting work, but it is important work. AI can help us do those tasks, allowing us to carry out more relevant tasks and focusing on adding real business value,” Mishra said.\nAs humans rely on AI to do some of the heavy lifting, agentic capabilities will continue to be added. Agentic AI has been hailed as a game-changing technology, as it is capable of taking actions or making decisions on our behalf. Mishra spoke about a colleague who created an agent to accept LinkedIn requests on his behalf, scouring through profiles and accepting requests based on certain criteria. He discussed how agentic AI is transforming software development by sharing key examples.\n“We orchestrate a lot of work, ranging from planning and task decomposition to architectural suggestions. Agents will be assigned this task, and they will propose different architectures,” he said.\nMishra said he had checked this approach and it was able to generate three different cost calculators on AWS for three different architectures. “I was able to choose which architecture works best. As a lot of you would know, no one architecture is best, right? It depends on your non-functional requirements, on scaling, the budget, and the kind of customers you have. Agentic AI can help you make these decisions,” he said.\nAt the end, Mishra spoke about the rise of specific AI agents in the future, for instance an agent that excels at solving healthcare, finance, or travel-related problems. He urged developers to keep learning, exploring and re-imagining the possibilities of AI in software development.",

            "title": "This startup is streamlining textile sourcing and financing for small businesses",
            "summary": "In India’s rapidly evolving retail landscape, small businesses often struggle with sourcing, financing, and logistics, among other operations. Enter Dukaan Dost, a Mumbai-based\nB2B ecommerce\nplatform trying to improve the way retailers and wholesalers operate.\nBy offering access to\ntextiles\n, financial solutions, and supply chain support, the company aims to make traditional businesses more efficient.\nFounded in 2019 by Heet Jain and Dhrati Jain, the startup addresses two major challenges faced by MSMEs—accessing high-quality raw materials and securing financing.\n“When I first started the business, it wasn't Dukaan Dost; it was just me learning how to purchase textile raw materials, such as yarns and fabrics, from local markets such as those in Bhiwandi, near Mumbai. I then used to try and sell them to other territories and make a small commission,” Heet tells\nYourStory\n. He started out as a commission agent and a small-time trader and soon got into larger operations.\nWhile Dukaan Dost began with domestic trade and smaller margins, the founders shifted to imported yarns and fabrics for higher margins.\nThe startup has so far catered to about 5,000 clients.\nThe journey and challenges\nOnce the company began receiving requests for imported yarns, Heet found that some suppliers on the ecommerce giant Alibaba were already exporting worldwide and sourced samples from them. However, financing these fabrics remained a major concern.\n“I didn't have enough money to run the business. So I used to take a 20% advance (of the fee) from the buyers,” Heet recalls, adding that he would assure them he knew where to source the fabric.\nOnce it began growing, Heet became much confident in his venture, and bootstrapped the company with Rs 2 crore from family and friends.\nHeet, who also runs Bluzen Clothing—a trader of spun yarns and knitted fabrics, saw a growing demand for Chinese, Indonesian, and Vietnamese products, including Cotton Indigo Dyed Siro Compact Yarn, which he was introduced to in Tiruppur.\n“Even though there was no proper market in India for this yarn, there was a huge demand for it because people could make denim out of it …  That was a turning point where we just grew exponentially from a basic trading company,” the co-founder says.\nAlso Read\nFashion + tech: How ZYOD is innovating textile manufacturing and optimising production\nTailoring its services\nDukaan Dost combines global sourcing with tailored financial solutions to empower small and medium enterprises to scale and compete with big-box retailers worldwide.\nIn India, its presence is in Mumbai, Panipat, Tanda, Ludhiana, Gurugram, Noida, Delhi, Bhiwandi, Ichalkaranji, Tarapur, Surat, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore, Palladam, Salem, Indore, and Tiruppur. It also operates overseas in Taiwan, Vietnam, and China.\nThe co-founders bet on specialised products to get high returns, which led them to venture into new territories and introduce new products in the Indian market.\n“We tried and tested with different types of\nyarns and fabrics\n; we tried to mix and create new products which would be significantly different from the others that were existing in the market,” he explains.\nThe company also set up an R&D team in China with three offices—an operational office, a sourcing office, and an R&D office. Dukaan Dost currently has around 18,000 products under its portfolio, some of which are proprietary and unique to the industry, explains Heet.\n“We’ve introduced yarns like Supercool, Vislone, Metallic, and Cool Cotton, along with innovative fabrics such as Everlon, Meta Sorona, and Monotone,” says the co-founder.\nDukaan Dost's signature fabric- Everlon\nWith a team of 40 in India and 25 abroad, the company’s inventory spans the entire textile value chain—from fibre and yarn to fabrics and garments. In 2024, it distributed around 30 million meters of fabric and 2,000 tons of yarn across India.\nDukaan Dost has an app and a website that allows customers to order samples, submit requests for quotes for yarns and fabrics, and the company also provides logistics support.\n“All orders and operations are then fed into and streamlined through our proprietary Dukaan Dost ERP system, which manages order processing, inventory, live tracking, analytics, and reporting,” says Heet.\nThe co-founder claims its signature Everlon fabric outperforms cotton in comfort, feel, breathability, durability, wrinkle resistance, and overall sustainability. It is an affordable alternative to expensive fabrics such as cotton, viscose, and nylon.\n“With Everlon, we've tried to give the same look, feel, and durability—the same properties that these expensive products do. For instance, the same cotton fabric would cost you around Rs 700 per kg, while Everlon would just cost Rs 350 per kg,” says Heet.\nThe company works with big brands as well as vendors supplying to big brands. Brands including Killer, Benetton, Cantabil, Gini & Jony, Siyaram, and Klub Fox have displayed Dukaan Dost’s products in their stores.\nIt also provides financial support to small businesses. For instance, if a garment manufacturer needs materials, the company will help them access them at global standards and also provide them with tailored credit solutions.\nIt also offers channel financing, a type of working capital loan that provides funds to channel partners (its clients), who purchase from them.\n“We have tied up with a few debt partners such as Stride Ventures, Black Soil Capital, and Indifi. Through these debt partners, we provide credit to\nMSMEs\nand help them fund their purchases with us,” explains Heet.\nThe startup partners with companies including Delhivery, Narang Carrying Corp, Supreme Transport, and VRL for logistics.\nAlso Read\nThis phygital logistics startup makes shipping sustainable for ecommerce and MSMEs\nWeaving a future\nWhile the company was founded in 2019, it took a backseat due to COVID-19 and became fully operational in September 2022. Following this, in the next six months, it clocked Rs 95 crore revenue, and in FY24, its topline grew to Rs 150 crore. The company said that its FY25 revenue also stands at Rs 150 crore. It aims to reach Rs 250 crore in FY26.\nDukaan Dost operates through its app and website for users to order. It allows ordering for samples of 1-2 kg, meanwhile, the bulk orders go up to 2,000 kg.\nIt plans to start its B2C offering, ‘Monotone’, a clothing brand, sometime this year. Operating with an ecommerce site, it plans to supply pan-India and further expand overseas.\nDukaan Dost has warehouses in Bhiwandi, Chennai, and Ludhiana, along with four experience centres, and the company is looking to raise funds to expand this to about 20. It plans to raise about Rs 100 crore over the next 12-18 months to expand its footprint across key textile hubs and enter new markets.\nIt competes with Locofast, Udaan, and used to compete with\nReshamandi\npreviously, notes Heet.\nThe company, which is currently providing services from fiber to fabric, will become fiber to fashion with the launch of its clothing brand and also home furnishing.\nEdited by Kanishk Singh",

            "title": "From spray-and-pray to precision: VCs shift gears in deeptech playbook",
            "summary": "It was meant to be a celebration—another event where everyone pats each other's backs for doing a great job at whatever they do. Instead, as entrepreneurs and investors gathered at Startup Mahakumbh earlier this month, they found themselves facing an unexpected reality check.\nCommerce Minister Piyush Goyal, never one to mince words, dropped what can only be described as a truth bomb on the world's third-largest startup ecosystem. The digital realm\nerupted\nalmost immediately as founders and VCs who had arrived expecting validation found themselves on the defensive.\nThe Minister had veered sharply from the expected script of nationalist tech cheerleading. Rather than the customary platitudes about Indian innovation, Goyal painted a sobering picture of a country struggling to keep pace with global competitors.\nHe made pointed remarks about how other countries are making leaps and bounds in innovation, especially in artificial intelligence and semiconductors, while India, in his view, is falling behind. The internet was quick to read between the lines, interpreting the comments as a reference to China’s DeepSeek and its accelerating progress in advanced technologies.\nThough the reaction was immediate, the unease ran deeper. While India’s deeptech ecosystem is still evolving, the criticism underscored a reality that many in the startup world already acknowledge—building truly innovative, research-driven companies remains a work in progress. At the same time, venture capitalists are gradually learning how to engage with these complex, tech-heavy ventures.\nIn recent months, the growing excitement around AI and deeptech has begun to reshape investor priorities. Recognising the distinct growth trajectory of these companies, many Indian investors are now adapting their strategies—but not without caution. There is enthusiasm, but there is also a clear understanding that deeptech demands a different playbook.\nFunding activity in the segment reflects this shift. Some investors are now gaining access to longer windows to support follow-on rounds, while others are taking a more tailored approach, focusing on specific sub-segments within deeptech. It’s no longer a one-size-fits-all strategy.\nThe momentum is backed by data. Between January and March this year, 24 deeptech startups raised around $169 million, according to Venture Intelligence. That’s a significant uptick compared to the same period in 2024, when just 17 startups raised a total of $107 million.\nStill, the numbers haven’t reached the highs of 2023, when 31 deals brought in $396 million—the most capital the sector has seen since 2018. But even so, current funding levels have surpassed those of 2022 and 2021, years that were otherwise buoyed by a broader tech funding surge.\nIn the wake of Goyal’s remarks, the spotlight is firmly on the deeptech space. The criticism may have sparked a wave of defensiveness, but it also seems to have reignited urgency—and a renewed focus—around building for the long haul.\nNumber of deep-tech deals in Q1 2025 has been higher than Q1 2024\nTailoring a term sheet\nInvestors are being more calculative while scouting for talent in the deeptech pool, often trying to keep in mind the funding needs of the startup as well as the returns they have to churn out for their limited partners at the end of the fund tenure.\nVC firms making investments with an eye on the long game are strategically allocating risk capital, often placing bold bets shortly after raising a new fund, for instance. This would give the startups the much-needed window to commercialise their innovations and the VCs, time to churn out the returns.\n“If you take our Rs 400 crore fund, Seed and Series B (funding), we need a commitment period, but a large part of our deeptech seed space will happen in year one and year two. To make sure we get the longest part of the tenure there, you've got to play it differently,” says Ashish Taneja, Founding Partner and CEO at growX Ventures, an early and growth stage investment firm that looks at deeptech and business-to-business (B2B) segments.\nMany believe the reason VC firms are taking these strategy calls is due to the comparatively longer gestation periods that deeptech firms take. However, according to Taneja, this is largely a misconception.\n“Within deeptech, there is a misconception that it takes eight to ten years to commercialise. It may be the case for a group of investors who are maybe thinking about figuring out a scientific breakthrough and then seeing its use cases and everything. But what we have observed is, there are companies building products that can be commercialised in three to five years.”\nAnother strategic way of sifting through the large influx of deeptech startups today is by filtering the use case for the product that is being built and the market it caters to.\n“The way we view deeptech is that you have to build in India, but the product has to be globally acceptable because that's what eventually will make the company large. India itself is a very small market for the purchase of deeptech,” says Kanika Mayar, Partner at Vertex Ventures SEA & India, an early and growth stage investment firm. In February, the firm led a $16 million Series A funding round into deeptech startup Spyne.\nAs VCs step up the criteria for investments into the sector, up-and-coming startups have evolved both in terms of the technology being built as well as the founder mindset.\nAverage cheque size in Q1 2025 is higher than Q1 2024 but remain lower than 2022 and 2023 levels\nThe deeptech evolution\nThe Indian deeptech ecosystem is relatively nascent, with big-ticket funding and companies alike still emerging as the segment matures.\n“The reality is that the market has seen only a few outcomes from deeptech in India yet. And it is not a single person's fault. It is a maturity of the ecosystem. It is a measure of where we are as a country, as a nation. It's an evolution,” says Arpit Agarwal, Partner at Blume Ventures.\nAgarwal adds that at the end of the day, VCs are answerable to their limited partners (LPs). “If our sector or any investment, any subsector, delivers inferior returns, then it is my fiduciary responsibility to take less interest in it. The only thing that I can think of about deep-tech and how to support deeptech is by having a lot more patience and by having a different approach to things. Like, for example, I should have patience about the company taking a few years before the product comes to life, given that the company might have a lot of scientific uncertainty and growth playbooks may not be clearly established, ” he added.\nDespite these companies taking a longer period of time to achieve product market fit and revenue realisation, for VC firms, it is a segment of high risks and high returns.\nAlso Read\n‘Invested in 18 deeptech cos over the past 5 years’: Info Edge's Bikhchandani on India’s deeptech debate\n“If you took five or six years to build a cutting-edge product, by default, the assumption is that it is a very complex product that 20 others have not built. Therefore, in the market, you have higher demand, you have pricing power, so on and so forth. So your revenue uptake in the first one to two years after commercialisation will be very fast,” says Arjun Rao, Partner at Speciale Invest, an early-stage deeptech-focused VC firm.\nToday, there is significant funding coming into the ecosystem at the seed and Series A level. According to data from Venture Intelligence, the first quarter of the year saw 16 seed-stage funding rounds with a deal value of $29 million and four Series A rounds with a total deal value of $31 million.\nDeeptech company Spyne’s co-founder, Sanjay Varnwal, echoes Rao’s comment. “If you are doing and solving the right kind of problem statement, it can get you to the revenue journey much quicker than earlier time frames,” he says. Spyne primarily serves automotive dealers in the US and Europe.\nThe company recently\nraised $16 million\nin a Series A round led by Vertex Ventures.\nHowever, Rao added that deeptech companies at a pre- or early-commercialisation stage are struggling to raise subsequent funding rounds. “At the pre-revenue and early commercialisation stage is where maybe there's a little gap in the ecosystem. But it is also starting to get filled. However, we are very early in that life cycle and hence, the next few years are when this will play out.”\nEdited by Jyoti Narayan",

            "title": "How RBI's decision is helping finance companies bounce back",
            "summary": "The Reserve Bank of India lowered risk weights on bank loans to non-banking finance companies when NBFC lending dropped significantly. This aims to rebuild bank confidence in extending credit during the economic slowdown. Easing capital requirements for banks lending to NBFCs represents a strategic step supporting liquidity flow within the financial sector.\nA 0.25 percentage point cut in risk weights attracts banks to NBFC lending. Banks need less capital allocation against loans, reducing costs. Cheaper loans for NBFCs improve credit availability throughout India for retail borrowers and small businesses. NBFCs can increase loan disbursements without high-cost borrowing, making financial services accessible to more people.\nBank lending to NBFCs hit a four-year low of 6.7% in 2024, according to RBI data. November 2023's higher risk weights alongside tight credit conditions drove this decline. Credit supply contraction impacted NBFCs' funding ability across various sectors, especially MSMEs, consumer lending, and infrastructure financing. The revision should prompt banks to adjust lending strategies, addressing critical liquidity challenges. Restored confidence might encourage longer-tenure loans to NBFCs, enabling better financial planning and stability.\nWithin India's financial ecosystem, NBFCs have maintained consistent importance, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%, according to Care Ratings. From FY17 to FY24, these institutions held around 21-24% of the total credit share, while banks accounted for roughly 70% and All India Financial Institutions comprised around 5-7%. Financing demands will grow as India targets a $5 trillion economy, highlighting NBFCs' economic expansion role. Their penetration into semi-urban and rural markets bridges credit gaps for underserved communities.\nAssets classes like Vehicle financing may gain from the RBI's decision. Crisil Ratings projects vehicle financing NBFC assets under management to reach Rs 8.1 lakh crore by March 2025, up from Rs 5.9 lakh crore in March 2023 - representing ~17% compound annual growth. This demonstrates sector resilience and expansion potential. Demand for vehicle loans, particularly commercial and electric vehicles, should rise with logistics and mobility sector growth. Lower NBFC borrowing costs will create competitive interest rates for borrowers, fostering industry growth.\nCommercial loan demand expanded with increased economic activity. July-September 2023 saw 29% growth versus 2022. MSME credit demand at NBFCs grew fastest at 39%, constituting 14% of total credit demand. This underscores NBFCs' importance for smaller businesses. Given MSMEs' critical contribution to employment and GDP, credit access remains crucial. The RBI's move helps sustain momentum by improving financing options.\nNBFC lending to MSMEs expanded 42.4% year-over-year in 2022-23, while banks grew just 12.4%. This highlights how NBFCs bridge financing gaps with loan structures suited for small businesses. Many MSMEs struggle to secure traditional bank loans due to strict credit assessment policies. NBFCs fulfill unmet demand efficiently through flexible underwriting methods and quicker loan disbursal.\nThe policy shift supports MSME lending, ensuring working capital and investment fund access. Microfinance asset quality concerns may moderate immediate growth, requiring regulatory monitoring. While increased liquidity helps, balancing growth with financial prudence prevents excessive risk-taking by NBFCs.\nRisk weight reversal and deferment of the proposed Liquidity Coverage Ratio framework should improve bank credit growth in FY26 versus FY25. NBFCs regaining bank credit access strengthens financing capacity across sectors. Bank funding availability enables NBFCs to expand product portfolios including personal loans, home loans, and business financing. Increased credit supply creates ripple effects across industries like real estate, consumer goods, and automobile sales.\nThe finance sector anticipates recovery as credit conditions stabilize. Steady fund flows reinforce NBFCs' position, enabling growth across key economic areas. This adjustment accelerates NBFC recovery while enhancing its contribution to India's economic advancement. Consumer confidence improves when liquidity abounds, boosting credit market participation.\nThis policy change happens amid global economic uncertainties. NBFCs serve as intermediaries reaching underserved customer segments through physical branch-based distribution networks in semi-urban and rural areas, supporting nationwide financial inclusion. With more households and businesses requiring formal credit, NBFCs ensure equitable financial access. The RBI's decision strengthens its operational capacity for offering customized loan products.\nInvestors recognise new opportunities in financial services. Companies with strong asset quality and diverse funding sources benefit most. Reduced risk weights stabilize funding costs, potentially improving margins for well-managed NBFCs. Market confidence should improve, attracting investment inflows and boosting stock market performance for listed finance companies. Stronger NBFC players can explore growth through mergers, acquisitions, and expansions.\nRetail consumers benefit from increased credit availability as NBFCs expand lending portfolios. These institutions serve millions with tailored products from housing loans to consumer durables financing. Improved liquidity enables more competitive interest rates and flexible repayment terms, making loans accessible to middle and lower-income borrowers.\nNBFCs remain essential to India's developing financial infrastructure. The RBI's decision acknowledges their importance while implementing prudential growth measures. This benefits the overall economy while maintaining oversight, creating a resilient financial system supporting India's economic objectives. Balancing growth with financial discipline ensures sector robustness against future economic fluctuations.\nAs the financial ecosystem evolves, NBFCs will become even more significant. Recent regulatory changes reaffirm the RBI's commitment to a stable, growth-oriented financial landscape. Enhanced liquidity and eased credit constraints pave the way for stronger economic participation from businesses and individuals. Long-term impacts include sustained credit expansion, improved business viability, and enhanced financial inclusion across India.\nJitendra Tanwar,  Managing Director & CEO of Namdev Finvest\n(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)",

However, the company withheld statements from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC).\nInstead, Gensol shared conduct letters from these firms stating that the company had been regularly servicing its debt. Notably,\nBluSmart\n—the EV ride-hailing company that leased the majority of its cars from Gensol—had reportedly defaulted on Rs 30 crore of bonds in early February this year. However, the company had said that bond payments were made.\nUpon further investigation, both IREDA and PFC denied issuing the conduct letters. This triggered further investigation, which exposed that the firm raised loans from institutions like IREDA and PFC to buy electric vehicles, but only used a portion of these funds for the same.\nAn amount of Rs 262.13 crore remains unaccounted for, according to SEBI's detailed analysis of the company’s bank statement as well as that of Go-Auto Private Limited—the dealer that supplied\nEV\ns to the company.\nAlso Read\nRefex Green Mobility drops plans with Gensol to take over BluSmart cabs\nAccording to the document, a portion of these unaccounted funds was used for personal expenses of the promoters, including the purchase of high-end real estate, and was transferred to close relatives of promoters.\n“The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a proprietary firm,” the market watchdog noted.\nThese transactions, SEBI noted, would need to be, at some time, written off from Gensol’s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the company.\nAdditionally, SEBI also took note of the recent 1:10 stock split Gensol had announced. The watchdog noted that this step will likely attract more retail investors, which, considering the results of the investigation, would not be in the interest of the investors. SEBI issued that the stock split be put on hold.\nShares of Gensol were down about 2.3% at Rs 130.15 apiece on April 15.\nEdited by Kanishk Singh",

Who is he?\nIn-Depth\nVCs shift gears in deeptech playbook\nWhile India’s deeptech ecosystem is still evolving, Union Minister Piyush Goyal's criticism underscored a reality—building truly innovative, research-driven companies remains a work in progress. At the same time, venture capitalists are gradually learning how to engage with these complex, tech-heavy ventures.\nSome investors are now gaining access to longer windows to support follow-on rounds, while others are taking a more tailored approach, focusing on specific sub-segments within deeptech. It’s no longer a one-size-fits-all strategy.\nTailored capital:\n“Within deeptech, there is a misconception that it takes eight to ten years to commercialise... But what we have observed is, there are companies building products that can be commercialised in three to five years,” says Ashish Taneja, Founding Partner and CEO at growX Ventures\nSignificant funding is coming into the ecosystem at the seed and Series A level. According to data from Venture Intelligence, the first quarter of the year saw 16 seed-stage funding rounds with a deal value of $29 million and four Series A rounds with a total deal value of $31 million.\n“The way we view deeptech is that you have to build in India, but the product has to be globally acceptable because that's what eventually will make the company large. India itself is a very small market for the purchase of deeptech,” says Kanika Mayar, Partner at Vertex Ventures SEA and India.\nFunding Alert\nStartup: CENTA\nAmount: Rs 20 Cr\nRound: Series A1\nStartup: Rio Innobev\nAmount: Rs 10 Cr\nRound: Pre-Series A\nInterview\nMaking smartphones in India\nAcer has launched two new homegrown phones, the ZX and ZX Pro. They are made by Bengaluru-based electronics company Indkal Technologies. The Bengaluru firm, which previously engineered Acer’s television and appliance lines for the Indian market, spent two years developing the 5G phones with competitive specifications.\nBuilding in-house:\nWhile Acer provides the brand license and ensures alignment on quality and design language, Indkal claims full ownership of the product development lifecycle—from chipset integration and component selection to software optimisation.\n“We work heavily through ecommerce. We also have a very large offline distribution setup with more than 140 distributors across the country covering TVs, washing machines, ACs, refrigerators, and now smartphones,” Anand Dubey, CEO, Indkal Technologies, tells\nYourStory\n.\n“For now, India remains the focal point for us. This market is immense in terms of size, and the scope remains largely untapped in many areas. For instance, air conditioning penetration in India is still under 10%,” he adds.\nStartup\nOne-stop shop for textile MSMEs\nIn India’s rapidly evolving retail landscape, small businesses often struggle with sourcing, financing, and logistics, among other operations. Enter Dukaan Dost, a Mumbai-based B2B ecommerce platform trying to improve the way retailers and wholesalers operate.\nBy offering access to textiles, financial solutions, and supply chain support, the company aims to make traditional businesses more efficient.\nKey takeaways:\nWith a team of 40 in India and 25 abroad, the company’s inventory spans the entire textile value chain—from fibre and yarn to fabrics and garments. In 2024, it distributed around 30 million meters of fabric and 2,000 tons of yarn across India.\n“We have tied up with a few debt partners such as Stride Ventures, Black Soil Capital, and Indifi. Through these debt partners, we provide credit to MSMEs and help them fund their purchases with us,” explains co-founder Heet Jain.\nDukaanDost became fully operational in September 2022. Following this, in the next six months, it clocked Rs 95 crore revenue, and in FY24, its topline grew to Rs 150 crore. The company said that its FY25 revenue also stands at Rs 150 crore. It aims to reach Rs 250 crore in FY26.\nNews & updates\nCooling:\nIndia’s annual inflation rate fell for a fifth straight month to a lower-than-expected 3.34% in March. The reading came in slightly below the 3.61% seen in February, as growth in food prices continued to soften. Food inflation hit 2.69%, led by a fall in prices for vegetables, spices, eggs, and pulses.\nEV sales:\nGlobal sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 29% YoY to 1.7 million in March, helped by growth in China and Europe. Sales in China were up 36% to almost 1 million vehicles, while Europe reported a 24% YoY rise in registrations to 0.4 million cars sold.\nValuation:\nNetflix aims to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalisation and double its revenue by 2030.

            "title": "How battery recycling can solve India’s EV waste crisis before it begins",
            "summary": "In India, we are at the brink of an\nelectric vehicle\n(EV) revolution. The government is pushing a target of 30% EV adoption by 2030, and automakers are introducing electric models—all actions aimed at creating an electric future. This future comes with a hidden challenge: battery waste. EV batteries (lithium-ion primarily), which are at the heart of EVs, have a lifespan of 8-10 years. After their lifespan is depleted, they become a ticking environmental time bomb without a\nwaste\ndisposal and contingency plan.\nIn 2024,\nEVs\naccounted for approximately 7.4% of all vehicles sold in India, up from 6.38% in 2023, according to the data from the Vahan portal cited in the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles. India is expected to generate over 500,000 metric tons of used\nlithium-ion batteries\nready for recycling by 2030, noted a report by the Confederation of Indian Industry. These bulky batteries will overfill landfills, be a fire hazard, and leak chemicals like cobalt, nickel and lithium into soil and water, causing environmental damage, and their valuable contents will be lost for use if we do not have a plan to manage this waste.\nThe question is: now that we can foretell the problem and its magnitude, can we prevent it? Could we perhaps have an opportunity in the wake of preventing the crisis? If India could build a circular economy for battery materials, ensuring no dead battery ends up in landfills and instead is mined for its contents remade into new batteries or other goods, we have a solution and an opportunity at hand. This is where battery recycling comes in—a solution that we must adopt before the waste crisis begins.\n(Representative image)\nAlso Read\nInventus wants to win the solid-state battery race in India\nLearning from EV blueprints\nChina, the world’s largest EV market, faced the same scenario a decade ago. By 2020, China was producing over 240 metric kilotons of waste EV batteries yearly (Ellen McArthur Foundation) and it effectively managed to turn the waste problem into an opportunity and built a robust battery recycling system. With the combination of government policies and innovation in recycling, by 2021, China had a recycling capacity of nearly 188 metric kilotons of used lithium-ion batteries, according to a\nCanary Media\nreport.\nOn the other hand, other countries with mature EV markets are grappling with the economic and logistical challenges of recycling. In the US, battery recycling is not economically viable on a large scale yet, as collection, transportation and processing costs often outweigh the value of recovered materials.\nAll of these global insights contain valuable lessons for India. The success of the EU (current capacity estimate: 300,000 metric tons) and China’s regulatory support can be mimicked, and the US’ scale and logistical challenges can be avoided in India, but we also have to consider our unique context. India has a growing demand for metals and a nascent\nEV market\n, making it possible to build an efficient recycling ecosystem.\nThe Indian scenario\nSince the EV market is still nascent, India’s EV battery manufacturing is still in its early stages. Hence, we do not need a circular economy for batteries as there is no established battery manufacturing or CAM/pCAM (precursor cathode active material) manufacturing (required for manufacturing battery cathode material). However, EV recycling is a must to effectively prevent EV battery waste buildup and provide valuable materials, with a lower carbon footprint.\nCopper, aluminium, nickel and plastics (which are contained in batteries) are widely used across industries such as construction, electrical, automotive, etc—all extremely important industries in a growing economy like ours. What we need is a circular economy for metals and plastics. Almost 38% of India’s copper demand is met from scrap, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines. India has a huge demand for aluminium and nickel scrap as well. The coming battery waste volumes can easily be harnessed for this demand.\nFor recycling to avoid the pitfalls faced by the US of high collection, logistics and processing costs, the technologies used need to be efficient in recovery rates, and the value of recovered materials must recover operational costs. Collection and pre-processing can be decentralised for better streamlining of operations. We already have an advantage as India can support large-scale\noperations\nand keep labour costs low. China also has a problem of a shadow economy of unregistered recyclers, with many of the recyclers not being registered and operating without following government norms and environmental and safety regulations. With a strong regulatory framework, India can avoid the same.\nThe way forward\nOur\npolicy\nframeworks need to be strong, to incentivise recycling. Public awareness is also critical. Battery Waste Management rules, 2022 are a step in the right direction by the government but more needs to be done.\nIndia’s EV journey is just beginning, and we can set a global example in sustainability. By investing in the development of low carbon recycling technologies and focusing on the circular economy of metals we can address the future challenge of battery waste before it becomes a crisis. By creating value from waste, instead of just managing waste, we can ensure that India’s EV revolution is not only green but also sustainable for generations to come.\n(Shubham Vishvakarma is the Founder and Chief of Process Engineering at Metastable Materials Private Limited.)\nEdited by Kanishk Singh\n(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)",

            "summary": "Omnichannel lab-grown diamond player Jewelbox raised $3.2 million in its pre-Series A round to fuel its retail expansion.\nThe round was led by V3 Ventures, along with participation from Atrium Angels, Dexter Ventures, Infinyte Club, Samarthya Capital, and existing investor JIIF.\nThe\nShark Tank-\nfamed startup plans to allocate the majority of its funds towards retail expansion. It is currently present across eight locations and targets 30 stores by the end of this year.\nA portion of funds is also expected to be used to strengthen its brand-building efforts and to build its team. It plans to hire key managerial positions from the retail segment and in trade.\n“At V3 Ventures, we’re excited about the potential of lab-grown diamonds to truly democratize access to luxury in India. Less than 6% of Indians own diamonds today,” says Arjun Vaidya, Co-founder and Managing Partner at V3 Ventures. “What impressed us most about Jewelbox is the team’s ability to execute flawlessly across online and offline channels, even outside their home markets.”\nAlso Read\nShining bright: The rise of lab-grown diamonds in India\nThe Kolkata-based company was founded by siblings Vidita Kochar and Nipun Kochar in 2022. It closed the previous financial year with an ARR of Rs 38 crore and has a target to cross Rs 180 crore this year while maintaining its profitability.​​\nLab-grown diamonds, also known as man-made diamonds, are manufactured by replicating geological processes in a laboratory on a graphite chip or diamond seed.\n\"Lab-grown diamonds are part of an industry that's still in the making. More players will enter and try to capture market share, but the right to win depends on two key factors. One is how much trust and credibility you can build around the brand, because people buy from players they trust—those with customer-friendly policies, good service, and a strong overall experience. The second is reaching consumers where they are and being present across multiple touchpoints,\" Vidita Kochar Jain, Co-founder, Jewelbox tells YourStory.\nThe lab-grown diamond space has attracted strong investor interest, with several players securing funding, prompting significant competition.\nIn March, Firefly raised $3 million in a seed round led by WestBridge Capital. Just a month earlier,\nSolitario Lab Grown\nsecured $3.6 million in its pre-IPO round. Around the same time,\nCOLUXE\n, founded by Kalaari Capital's Priyanka Gill, raised seed funding, while Limelight bagged $11 million in investment.

            "summary": "“Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience... The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important.”\n—\nHunter S. Thompson, 1958 letter to Hume Logan\nIn today’s hyper-focused, goal-obsessed world, few voices cut through the noise like Hunter S. Thompson’s. Known for his bold writing and unconventional life, Thompson offered a simple but profound insight:\nDon’t aim to become something. Aim to live a certain way.\nIt’s advice that challenges the way society thinks about success, ambition, and identity.\nYour Experiences Shape You\nThompson believed people are not defined by titles or plans. They are defined by how they react to the world around them.\n“Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience.”\nThis means identity is not fixed. It changes. As we go through life, we gather experiences. Those experiences shape how we see the world—and how we see ourselves. The more we live, the more we evolve.\nAnd because we change, our goals should change too.\nGoals Can Be Limiting\nFrom childhood, we're told to set goals. Career goals. Financial goals. Life goals. But Thompson questioned this thinking.\n“The answer must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway.”\nHe warned that rigid goals can trap us. A goal set at 18 may not reflect who you are at 30. But people still chase it—because they feel they must. Instead of growing, they shrink to fit their past ambitions.\nChoose the Way You Want to Live\nThe heart of Thompson’s message is this:\n“A man who has found meaning has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but... chosen a way of life he knows he will enjoy.”\nIt’s a simple shift. Instead of asking \"What do I want to be?\" ask\n\"How do I want to live?\"\nDo you want freedom? Stability? Creativity? Structure? The right goal isn’t a title—it’s a rhythm of life that makes sense to you.\nThe Journey Matters More\nThompson believed the real value wasn’t in hitting the goal. It was in how you moved toward it.\n“The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important.”\nThis is where many go wrong. They focus only on results. But if you hate the process, the result won’t make you happy. The work should energise you. The path should make you feel alive.\nA Message for Today\nIn a time of job titles, personal branding, and career ladders, Thompson’s words feel radical.\nThey remind us that it's okay to change direction. It's okay to grow out of old goals. What matters is whether your daily life reflects who you are now—not who you were then.\nFinal Takeaway\nSuccess isn’t about reaching a fixed point. It’s about choosing a way to live that fits who you are—and letting your goals follow naturally.\nSo if you're feeling lost or stuck, start here:\nAsk yourself not what you want to become. Ask how you want to live.",

            "summary": "Acer has launched two new homegrown phones, the ZX and ZX Pro. They are made by Bengaluru-based electronics company Indkal Technologies.\nThe Bengaluru firm, which previously engineered Acer's television and appliance lines for the Indian market, spent two years developing the 5G phones with competitive specifications.\nThe Acer ZX is positioned for everyday use and costs Rs 9,990. It features a large 6.78-inch LCD display with full HD+ resolution and a refresh rate of 120Hz, which allows for smoother animations and scrolling. Meanwhile, the Acer ZX Pro, priced at Rs 17,990, is a more advanced alternative for users seeking improved design, display quality, and photography performance.\nIndkal Technologies is a unique player in India’s consumer electronics space. The company began its journey licensing the\nAcer trademark\nfor televisions and later, surprisingly, washing machines—a bit of an odd foray for a brand better known globally for computing products.\nBut these weren’t rebadged imports. The washing machines were developed entirely in-house, tailored for Indian households and built from the ground up by Indkal’s R&D team.\n“R&D is our largest manpower expense. We have a robust in-house engineering team, along with dedicated divisions for PCB design and validation. We also work with design solution partners when necessary. Our company DNA is heavily product-centric,” Anand Dubey, CEO, Indkal Technologies, tells\nYourStory\n.\nAppliances made by Indkal Technologies\nNow, Indkal is applying this same\nplaybook to smartphones\n. The Acer-branded phones are conceptualised, designed, and engineered by Indkal's team in India and have been in the works for two years. ZX is equipped with a triple camera system on the back, including a 64 MP sensor for high-resolution images, and is powered by the Mediatek 6300 chipset.\nPerformance-wise, the ZX Pro is powered by the Mediatek 7400 chipset and offers more memory and storage options compared to the ZX. The Pro also offers an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and higher protection against dust and water.\nWhile Acer provides the brand license and ensures alignment on quality and design language, Indkal claims full ownership of the product development lifecycle—from chipset integration and component selection to software optimisation.\nIn a conversation with\nYourStory\n, Dubey delves into the journey to creating Indkal, its focus on R&D and in-house product development, and its partnership with Acer.\nAlso Read\nMobile phone exports surpass Rs 2 L Cr in FY25, powered by iPhone shipments, says Vaishnaw\nYourStory [YS]: Indkal started with Acer-branded TVs and even washing machines, which seems unusual for the Acer brand. What was the thinking behind that for Indkal Technologies?\nAnand Dubey [AD]:\nWe looked at the ecosystem and felt very strongly that Indian participation in this industry was limited. What we consume as Indian customers in consumer electronics and durables was global in nature, not created specifically for India. We were in a great position with our technical capability and our ability to innovate in products to create those minor and major changes, modifications, and improvements.\nYS: Can you give examples of India-specific innovations in your existing products?\nAD:\nIn TVs, we became the first company in India to launch a QLED display in a 32-inch size, disrupting the notion that 32-inch was only a price play. We also launched the first Android 14-based Google TVs in India, using a processor architecture not typically seen in TVs (ARM A55 and A75 combination) and incorporating a 2.2 audio system for better sound depth, as Indian customers often don't buy separate soundbars. In air conditioning, we launched a 7000 British Thermal Units (BTU) capacity AC because the heat in India is much stronger, so we needed something more powerful yet appropriately priced.\nYS: You emphasise in-house R&D. How significant is this to Indkal's strategy?\nAD:\nR&D is our largest manpower expense. We have a very large R&D team and quality management team, which allows us to work on multiple products simultaneously. We have dedicated teams working on component solutions like PCB design, manufacturing, and validation. The DNA of the company is all about building new products, improving or optimising technology, and creating better, interactive technology for customers.\nYS: How did the partnership with Acer come about, and what kind of guardrails does Acer set?\nAD:\nThe conversation started a long time back; we knew each other and our respective strengths from my consulting background. It was a very straightforward process to enter into the trademark license arrangement. There are always inputs from Acer on design language and product specs. There's also very strong management regarding how quality control and product development are handled. Most of the guardrails are set around the product's quality—hardware, software, validation of components, and the product as a whole. These parameters are agreed upon between us and Acer.\nYS: What is Indkal's distribution strategy?\nAD:\nWe're an omnichannel company. We work heavily through ecommerce. We also have a very large offline distribution setup with more than 140 distributors across the country covering TVs, washing machines, ACs, refrigerators, and now smartphones. Additionally, we work within modern trade, being present in national large-format retail chains like Reliance Digital, as well as other regional retail stores. Currently, we have almost an equal split between offline and online sales, with offline being slightly larger.\nYS: You work with manufacturing partners like Dixon instead of manufacturing yourself. What is the thought process behind it?\nAD:\nWe strongly subscribe to using manufacturers while developing products on our own because the roles are well-defined. Manufacturing is an operationally heavy process requiring efficiency and process adherence, which partners like Dixon do very well. R&D, building IPs, and innovation must be the fundamental base for what we are trying to create as an economy. To become a manufacturing hub, it's important that we not only focus on a small part of the value chain but also start building the entire value chain ourselves. This requires innovation, creating new products, and disrupting existing technology. Can we create the next evolution in TVs or washing machines? That's the direction we need to move in, building the infrastructure to support innovation and experimentation.\nYS: Are there plans to take these Indkal-developed Acer products beyond India?\nAD:\nFor now, India remains the focal point for us. This market is immense in terms of size, and the scope remains largely untapped in many areas. For instance, air conditioning penetration in India is still under 10%, whereas developed economies might see over 50%. We expect India will eventually reach higher penetration levels. This means the Indian market presents an overwhelmingly large opportunity, unlike anything most companies have seen. Therefore, our focus needs to remain here in India. We will re-evaluate international expansion once we have made more headway with our growth in India and have captured a larger part of what we aim to achieve domestically.\nEdited by Jyoti Narayan",

            "summary": "In recent months, social media platforms have been inundated with AI-generated images, from whimsical Studio Ghibli-inspired portraits to the viral \"Barbie Box\" trend. These creations, powered by tools like ChatGPT's GPT-4o and DALL·E, have captivated users worldwide. However, behind the allure of these digital artworks lies a significant environmental concern: the substantial energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with generative AI.​\nThe Energy Behind the Art\nGenerating a single AI image can consume between 0.01 to 0.29 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, comparable to running a refrigerator for up to half an hour . While this may seem negligible, the cumulative effect is staggering. A study by Carnegie Mellon University and Hugging Face found that producing 1,000 images using generative AI tools requires approximately 2.9 kWh, equivalent to fully charging an average smartphone multiple times.\nThe popularity of these trends has led to unprecedented demand on AI infrastructure. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, noted that the surge in image generation requests was so intense that it caused GPUs to overheat, prompting temporary limitations on the service.\nData Centers: The Unsung Energy Consumers\nThe backbone of AI image generation lies in data centers, which house the servers and hardware necessary for processing complex algorithms. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity consumption by data centers is projected to more than double by 2030, with AI-specific data centers alone expected to quadruple their energy demands.\nIn the United States, the energy used for AI processing could surpass that of traditional energy-intensive industries like steel and cement manufacturing. This escalation not only contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions but also places additional strain on electricity grids and water resources.\nThe Water Footprint\nBeyond electricity, AI operations significantly impact water resources. Cooling systems in data centers often rely on vast amounts of water to prevent overheating. For instance, training GPT-3 reportedly consumed approximately 700,000 liters of water, equivalent to the water footprint of manufacturing 320 electric vehicles . As AI adoption grows, so does its demand on freshwater supplies, raising concerns about sustainability, especially in regions facing water scarcity.​\nThe Path Forward\nWhile the environmental implications of AI are concerning, there are avenues for mitigation. Tech companies are exploring more energy-efficient hardware, optimising algorithms to reduce computational demands, and investing in renewable energy sources to power data centers. Additionally, implementing transparency measures, such as disclosing energy usage and carbon emissions, can foster accountability and drive industry-wide improvements.​\nAs consumers, being mindful of our digital habits and supporting sustainable practices can collectively make a difference. By balancing innovation with environmental responsibility, we can enjoy the benefits of AI while safeguarding our planet for future generations.​",

A large pole — part of a viaduct structure — fell off a truck and crushed the autorickshaw near Kogilu Cross.\nThe victim has been identified as Qasim Saab. According to the police, the accident took place around midnight when an 18-wheel truck transporting construction material from the Vadiyarpura casting yard lost balance while turning near Kogilu Junction at Yelahanka. The truck was carrying a girder, which slipped and fell onto Qasim’s moving autorickshaw, killing him on the spot.\nThe Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) issued a statement on April 15, confirming the incident. “BMRCL regrets to report a fatal accident that cost the life of an auto driver, who was killed in an unfortunate incident around 12 a.m. last night,” read the statement.\nThe statement further explained that the girder-laden truck had to brake suddenly to avoid a vehicle that had unexpectedly entered its path. This caused the girder to topple onto the autorickshaw. “Emergency services were pressed into action immediately, and the driver’s body was recovered using cranes. However, he was declared dead by medical personnel,” according to the statement.\nBMRCL has assured that the family of the deceased will be compensated as per protocol.\nThe local police have registered a case and are trying to ascertain the exact cause of the accident.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 11:56 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated stories\nTrack defect affects Bengaluru metro’s Green Line services briefly\nBengaluru: Chaos at Namma Metro Majestic station as train frequency dips\nYellow Line of Namma Metro likely to begin limited operations by June\nRelated Topics\nbengaluru\n/\npublic transport",

            "summary": "To bring together Sanskrit literature and reading tools, Antariksh Bothale, a Software Engineer from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, launched SanskritSahitya.org, a free website for anyone desiring quick access to Sanskrit literary texts, bringing his academic and professional experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) into the field of Sanskrit literature.\nMr. Bothale, an Indian Institute of Technology Bombay graduate, completed his Master’s in Computational Linguistics from the University of Washington, Seattle. He currently works at Google, California, on the Smart Home Assistant product.\nHis interest in languages and linguistics drove him to maintain a blog, Linguistrix (www.linguistrix.com) since 2011.\n“My overarching vision for the website is to make it the best experience for reading and analyzing Sanskrit literature, to leverage advancements in computational methods to aid the study and teaching for both casual readers and experts, and to help further computational work by amassing a rich structured corpus of Sanskrit texts in a consistent format,” shared Mr. Bothale.\nThe features of the website include a structured navigation based on\nsarga\n,\nadhyaaya\n,\nkaanda\n,\nshloka\netc. with easily shareable pages. Alongside the original text are metrical tagging, commentaries, translations and morphological analysis, that will keep getting updated as more content is digitized and organised with time.\nMr. Bothale said, “The website features links to other content as relevant, for example, whenever a commentary refers to a\nPaninian Sutra\n(a foundational text on Sanskrit grammar), or to a dictionary, that reference is linked to the actual\nsutra\nor dictionary page so that readers can learn more. I have also included\nchhanda\n(meter) tagging, analysis, along with a glossary of Sanskrit meters with details and audio demonstration of how to sing them. There is also a tool for users to search across all the texts, using both Devanagari and Romanized queries, which makes finding a specific\nshloka\nbased on partial text very easy. This can be a great tool for teachers looking to find a variety of literary examples or uncommon meters.”\nA screengrab of the website SanskritSahitya.org that offers easy navigation, commentaries with links to other Sanskrit resources, metrical analysis, and full-text search.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement\nIn the coming days, the website will include richer search features such as searching based on the root form of the word rather than the one that is used in the shloka; English summaries for all\nshlokas\n, powered by machine translation with human review; richer word index built across all the texts for getting more insights about usage patterns; support for rendering Sanskrit text in other Indian scripts; and ability to favorite a shloka to be able to come back to it easily on the same page. As time progresses, more texts with pronunciations and richer analysis will be added to increase the site’s coverage and reach.\nThe website can also be accessed offline, Mr. Bothale explained, “It takes a few seconds to download the entire data and then the content can be accessed offline on phone or desktop. Other scholars who wish to analyze the data in bulk can access it directly through the site’s GitHub repository at github.com/sanskritsahitya-com/data.”\nThe website currently features the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Mahakavya, and poems written by Kālidāsa and other poets, and other popular texts. Mr. Bothale said, “Sanskrit has a rich and vast body of literature that gives us a window into our forefathers’ lives and times and our common cultural past. Not many appreciate that Sanskrit literature like any other literature gives us deep insights into the human experience, spanning the full range of emotions and genres, whether it be comedy, romance, or poignant observations about everyday life.”\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 11:46 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nSanskrit\n/\ngovernment\n/\nsocial issue\n/\neducation\n/\ncustoms and tradition",

The two exchanged hugs before Mr. Vadra went inside the ED office.\nHe was questioned for about five hours on Tuesday (April 15), and his statement was recorded by the federal probe agency under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), official sources said.\nThe session will resume on Wednesday, the sources said. The 56-year-old Vadra had termed the ED action \"political vendetta\".\nHe said he has always cooperated with investigative agencies and has furnished huge amount of documents, stressing that there needs to be a closure in cases which are as old as 20 years.\nThe probe against Vadra is linked to a land deal in Haryana's Manesar-Shikohpur (now sector 83) in Gurugram.\nThe land deal of February 2008 was done by a company named Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd, where Mr. Vadra was a director earlier, as it purchased a 3.5 acre land in Shikohpur from a firm named Onkareshwar Properties at a price of ₹7.5 crore.\nA Congress government led by Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was in power that time.\nFour years later, in September, 2012, the company sold this 3.53 acre land to realty major DLF for ₹58 crore.\nThe land deal got into controversy in October, 2012 after IAS officer Ashok Khemka, then posted as the director general of Land Consolidation and Land Records-cum- Inspector-General of Registration of Haryana, cancelled the mutation of this categorising the transaction as violative of state consolidation Act and some related procedures.\nThe Opposition Haryana BJP then had called this case an instance of \"corruption\" in land deals and that of \"nepotism\" hinting at Vadra's kinship with the first family of the Congress party.\nHaryana Police filed an FIR to probe this deal in 2018.

            "summary": "India\nhas called out attempts to introduce new parameters such as religion and faith as the basis for representation in a reformed United Nations (UN) Security Council, asserting that this runs completely counter to the accepted basis of regional representation.\nIndia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador P. Harish told the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) meeting on ‘Size of the Future Council and cluster discussion on Regional Representation’ that those opposed to text-based negotiations do not seek progress on UNSC reforms.\n‘Exemplar’ — U.N. lauds India’s progress in child mortality reduction\n“Attempts to introduce new parameters, such as religion and faith, as the basis for representation in a reformed Council runs completely counter to regional representation, which has been the accepted basis for representation in the UN,” Ambassador Harish said in remarks made in his national capacity.\nHe added that the argument that an expanded and reformed Security Council would not be efficient is an attempt to stall real reforms.\n“A reformed Council, with appropriate working methods and accountability mechanisms, would be equipped to function effectively and deliver meaningfully on pressing global issues,” he said.\nIndia re-elected to U.N. Peacebuilding Commission\nIndia asserted that a consolidated model that does not cover expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, would not achieve the purpose of reform, further entrenching the status quo.\nBefore making the remarks in his national capacity, Mr. Harish delivered a statement on behalf of the G4 nations of Brazil, Germany, Japan and India, in which the grouping underscored that regional representation is an accepted practice that has stood the test of time in the UN.\n“Proposals to introduce new parameters, such as religious affiliation run counter to established UN practice and add considerable complexity to an already difficult discussion,” the G4 said.\nThe group noted that the existing UN architecture is from a different era, one that no longer exists and the current geopolitical realities warrant a review of this architecture. “Those who do not endorse real reforms that reflect contemporary realities fall on the wrong side of history, which is detrimental to all of us,” Mr. Harish said in the statement on behalf of the G4 nations.\nOutlining the broad contours of the G4 model for UNSC reform, a model that was presented and elaborated by the grouping during the IGN meetings in 2024, Mr. Harish said the Security Council membership needs to be increased from the current 15 to 25 or 26, with a reformed Council consisting of 11 permanent members and 14 or 15 non-permanent members.\nCurrently, the powerful UN organ consists of five permanent members — China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. The remaining 10 members are elected to sit at the horse-shoe table for two-year terms as non-permanent members. India had last sat in the Council as a non-permanent member in 2021-22.\nThe G4 nations reiterated that any reform not accompanied by expansion of both permanent and non-permanent categories is incomplete in the view of the broad membership.\n\"Member States which subscribe to the expansion of only the non-permanent category ignore the existing imbalances in the permanent category fully. Such an approach fails to address non-representation and underrepresentation in this category,” the grouping said adding that it does not address the legitimate aspirations of the developing world, Africa in particular, and is not aligned with the majority view, including those of L69 and the Common African Position.\n\"Adding only non-permanent members would hardly change the power dynamics in the Council and, thus, likely further the power of the permanent members,\" G4 said. Further, the group of four stressed that the path to achieve real reforms just like any other UN process is text-based negotiations, involving clearly defined timelines and milestones.\nWith the Pact for The Future last year recognising the urgency of this reform process, the G4 encouraged Member States and Regional Groups to submit further models of reforms in order to facilitate text-based negotiations. “We invite the Chair to start text-based negotiations now, ideally by the end of the current IGN,” they said.\nG4 further underlined that a decision on Member States that would become permanent members of a reformed Council is a decision to be taken by the General Assembly in a democratic manner.\nThe Uniting for Consensus (UfC) Group comprising Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Malta, Mexico, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, San Marino, Spain, Turkiye and Italy, reiterated its position of increasing the number of Security Council seats exclusively in the non-permanent category. UfC proposes a 27-member Security Council, without any increase in the number of permanent members, which currently stands at five.\nBahrain, delivering a statement on behalf of the Arab group, reiterated the demand for an Arab representation with full privileges in the permanent seat category in an expanded Council.\n\"We also reaffirm that just representation requires proportionate Arab representation in the non-permanent seat category within the expanded Security Council,” the Arab group said adding that its demands are based on objective criteria, namely the population size in the Arab countries and the number of Arab country members of the UN as well as the fact that many agenda items and issues before the Council relate to the Arab region.\n“This requires equitable and proportionate Arab representation within the expanded Security Council,” the Arab group said.\nFrance reiterated its support for India to sit in the Council as a permanent member. “We are in favour of granting two permanent seats to African states as well as for Brazil, India, Germany and Japan for the permanent seats that would be created for their geographical groups,\" France’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Jay Dharmadhikari said.\n\"France considers it legitimate for future permanent members to request all the prerogatives associated with this status, including the right of veto,” said Mr. Dharmadhikari.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 11:29 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nUnited Nations",

            "summary": "Malayalam actress Vincy Sony Aloshious has accused a co-actor of misbehaving with her during the shoot of a recent film, allegedly while under the influence of drugs. The\nRekha\nstar, who recently attended an anti-drug awareness event, has since been making headlines for stating she would not act in films with drug-using actors.\nKerala State Film Awards 2022: Actor Vincy Aloshious’ journey to the top from a talent show\nAddressing the backlash, Aloshious posted a video on Instagram, clarifying that her statement stemmed from personal experience. “Some days back at an anti-drug campaign programme, I made a statement that I will not do movies again with people I know who use drugs. I am doing this video because I wanted to make my stand clear,” she said.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by vincy_sony_aloshious (@iam_win.c)\nWithout naming the actor involved, Vincy detailed several troubling incidents from the set. “When I had a problem with my dress, I went to correct it. He said, ‘I will also come and correct it for you.’ He said this in front of everyone. It was very difficult to go ahead with the shoot,” she recounted.\nShe also alleged that the same actor was visibly using drugs on set. “When we were practising a scene, he was spitting some kind of white powder onto the table. It was very evident that he was using drug on the film set.”\nDespite informing the producers, Vincy said the production continued because the actor in question held a lead role. “Everyone knew about this. The director went and spoke. This is one person they took as main artist, so they had to somehow finish that movie,” she said.\nVincy’s revelation adds to the growing conversation around drug use in the Malayalam film industry. Industry insiders, including producers and members of AMMA, have spoken out about the issue, with some even claiming to have lists of known drug users. Police have also confirmed investigations are underway, with around 300 individuals linked to the drug trade under scrutiny —some of them reportedly from the film world.\nFEFKA proposes seven-member committee on film locations to check drug menace\nVincy Aloshious, who debuted with\nVikruthi\nin 2019, won acclaim with her State Award-winning performance in\nRekha\nand has appeared in\nJana Gana Mana\n,\nSaudi Vellakka\n, and\nMarivillin Gopurangal\n.\n(with inputs from ANI)\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 11:02 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nMalayalam cinema",

This is unprecedented since the establishment of the union in 1985,” Balachandra Jarkiholi , Chairman of BEMUL, said in Belagavi on April 15.\n“We have done so well that it has surpassed our expectations. It has been achieved only through prudent fiscal management and avoiding unnecessary expenditure,” the MLA told reporters.\n“The previous year, we clocked a modest profit of ₹68 lakh. However, this time, we have earned a profit of ₹13.20 crore. This has happened due to corruption-free administration, less funds used for the annual general meetings, and non-receipt of TA and DA by the members of the management board, and other reform measures,” he said.\n“The total turnover of BEMUL was ₹399.50 crore. This was higher than last year’s turnover of ₹320.83 crore. The profit has increased by about 24%. However, the union will not keep the profit for itself. It will distribute them among the farmers and reinvest it in strengthening the institution, like setting up machinery, decentralising the procurement and processing operations, and setting up units to produce milk by-products,” the Chairman said.\nProfits will be used for the welfare of milk producers, associations, contract workers, security guards, according to him.\nThe union has established a total of 1,002 milk producers’ cooperative societies in Belagavi district. Out of these, 610 milk producers’ cooperative societies are operational. Out of these, 160 are women’s societies. So far, share capital amounting to ₹622.10 lakh has been collected. There is a main dairy with a capacity of 1.50 lakh litres in Belagavi, cold storage centres with a capacity of 30,000 litres each in Ramadurga and Athani. It has a processing unit with a capacity of 60,000 litres in Raibag. A total of 39 BMC units have been established under the Central Government’s pure milk production and special package schemes. The Plexi Pack unit has a daily milk packing capacity of 80,000 litres.\n“As many as 43 new associations were established in the year 2024-25. An average of 2.10 lakh kg of milk is being procured daily. Compared to last year, there has been an increase of 22%. Also, a total of 12,797 cows have been provided insurance facilities at a concessional rate of 75% by the union. ₹1.22 crore has been provided via insurance to the owners of 245 cows that died. Artificial insemination services have been provided to 1,34,138 cows,” he said.\n“About 80 lakh litres of milk have been sold from the Plexi Unit to the local market and to the neighbouring State of Andhra Pradesh, 3,80,516 litres of ghee have been sold, 41,12,820 litres of curd have been sold, 1,73,746 kg of paneer has been sold, 74,245 kg of kunda has been sold. new 10-kg bucket yogurt sale has been started. 50 to 100 buckets of yogurt are being packed and sold daily in the markets of Belagavi district and in the neighbouring State of Goa,” he said.\nThe association has released buffalo milk to the Mumbai market, and 5,000 litres of milk are being sold daily.\nLast February, 2.50 lakh buttermilk packets of 130 ml pack were supplied to Saundatti Sri Yallamma temple.\nAn annual saving of ₹2.52 crore has been made in expenses.\nThe union is looking for land to set up a large dairy near a river bed or dam with access to the National Highway. “We are planning to set up a high-tech mega dairy with new technology at a cost of ₹350 crore,” the Chairman said.\n“The government of Karnataka is yet to release ₹9 crore production incentive to farmers from December 2024,” he said.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 10:04 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated stories\nIncrease in milk price will hit milk unions badly, says HAMUL president H.D.

            "title": "Study finds high-altitude winds and dry soil conditions caused heatwaves in 2022",
            "summary": "In the early spring of 2022,\nSouth Asian countrie\ns including India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan experienced back-to-back extreme heat waves in the months of March and April.\nA study published on April 8, 2025, by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Germany, has uncovered why South Asian countries experienced back-to-back extreme heat events in early spring of 2022.\nAlso read: Why is north and central India facing a severe heatwave? | Explained\nIn the study titled, ‘Contrasting drivers of consecutive pre-monsoon South Asian heatwaves in 2022: waveguide interaction and soil moisture depletion’ published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, a scientific journal of atmospheric research published by the American Geophysical Union; the research team found that these unusually intense heatwave events in March and April of 2022, were driven by different atmospheric processes that compounded heatwave impacts.\nLead author of the study, Roshan Jha, a PhD student at Centre for Climate Studies, IIT Bombay, said, “Our analysis shows that the March heatwave was primarily linked to a sudden increase in the amplitude of short-lived atmospheric Rossby waves, which are large-scale meanders in high altitude winds resembling bends in a winding river. The waves grew stronger as high-altitude westerly winds near the poles (extratropical jet stream) transferred energy to westerly winds closer to the equator (subtropical jet stream) as they came closer during the heatwave.”\nWhat does the new ‘State of the Climate in Asia’ report say? | Explained\nThe April heatwave happened differently as in, instead of being driven by wind patterns in high altitude, it was largely caused by very dry soil conditions and advection of heat to India from north-western land regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Co-author of the study, Arpita Mondal, Associate Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering and Centre for Climate Studies at IIT Bombay explained that importantly, these dry conditions were partly created by the earlier March heatwave, which had already dried out the land through high temperatures and clear skies.\n“This research reveals a concerning pattern: one heatwave can set the stage for another, more intense heat event in the following weeks by removing moisture from the soil. When soil becomes too dry, it creates a cycle that makes the next heatwave even worse. When soil has moisture, under the clear sky conditions, some of the sun’s energy goes into evaporating that moisture rather than heating the air. But when the soil is already dry, all that energy goes straight into making the air hotter,” she explained.\nHeatwave alert in Telangana as temperatures soar beyond 43°C\nSubimal Ghosh, Convener of Centre for Climate Studies, IIT Bombay and Professor at Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Bombay said that understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving our ability to forecast and prepare for extreme heat events in South Asia. “As climate change continues to affect atmospheric wind patterns, identifying these specific drivers helps us better predict and mitigate the impacts of future heatwaves,” he added.\nThe other co-authors are Professor Volkmar Wirth and Dr. Christopher Polster from Institute for Atmospheric Physics at Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Germany.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 10:01 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nweather science\n/\nheatwave",

            "summary": "There is mounting public anger in Athirappilly after three tribal persons were killed in two wild elephant attacks in two days. As fear grips forest-edge communities, the UDF has called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal in Athirappilly on Wednesday (April 16, 2025) for what they call the state government’s “criminal inaction” and “deafening silence.”\nAfter visiting the relatives of the deceased at Chalakudy hospital on Tuesday, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said that with the latest elephant attack on Monday night, the number of lives lost to wildlife attacks in the State this year alone has reached 18.\nThe latest victims, Satheesh and Ambika from the Sasthampooam tribal hamlet, were attacked on Monday night while collecting wild honey, near Vanchikkadavu, in the Vazhachal forest division. A day earlier, 20-year-old Sebastian from the Adichilthotty tribal settlement was killed in a similar incident at Malakkappara. The three were among several tribals camping temporarily in the forest— an age-old practice during the honey-harvesting season.\nLocal people suspect Manjakomban, a wild elephant known to frequent the area and believed to be in musth, is behind the attacks. Survivors say the elephants appeared suddenly and charged without warning. While some managed to flee, Satheesh and Ambika could not escape. It is also suspected that they may have jumped into a river and drowned.\nOpposition slams govt.\nThe UDF has come out strongly against the Left government, accusing it of standing by as people are killed one after another. “The Forest Minister has done nothing but seek reports. If he can’t act, what’s the point of holding the chair?” asked Mr. Satheeshan. All major political parties are expected to support the strike.\n“Every time there’s a tragedy, the Forest Minister promises a permanent solution. But nothing ever changes,” the UDF leaders alleged. “The government’s apathy has crossed every limit. Even the District Collector has not bothered to visit the site. Is this how a responsible administration functions?” they asked.\nDemands for wildlife squads\nThe UDF has demanded the immediate deployment of special wildlife squads in elephant-prone areas, equipped to monitor animal movements and alert local communities before tragedies occur. They also called for sustainable livelihood alternatives for tribal populations who depend on forest produce, like honey, for survival.\n“Simply saying that the ‘forest is the animal’s home’ no longer holds,” said Mr. Satheeshan. “Under the Forest Rights Act, tribals live and work inside forests. It is the government’s duty to ensure their safety, he asked”\nA State in crisis\nOver the last six years, more than a thousand people have reportedly died from wildlife attacks in Kerala, with thousands more injured. Yet, no permanent policy has been implemented to protect residents in high-risk zones.\n“The government has washed its hands of the problem. When five people were killed in a single week this February, the Minister promised immediate action. But nothing happened. Not even a symbolic visit from a senior official,” said the UDF leader.\nThe Opposition has warned of intensifying protests across the State if the government fails to act. “The government must stop treating wildlife attacks as isolated incidents. We are facing an extraordinary crisis that needs extraordinary urgency.”\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 08:49 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT",

            "title": "Are births and deaths being properly registered in India? | Explained",
            "summary": "The story so far:\nOn March 17, the office of the Registrar General of India\n(RGI) cautioned private and government hospitals to report incidents of births and deaths within 21 days\n,\nThe Hindu\nreported. This circular by the Vital Statistics division of the RGI, which works under the Union Home Ministry (MHA), was issued after it was found that many medical institutions were flouting the law.\nWhat did the March 17 circular say?\nThe circular stated that around 10% of births and deaths are not getting registered in the country. It said that while 90% of birth or death events are getting registered and significant progress has been made towards the goal of universal registration, “the target of 100% registration” is yet to be achieved. According to an RGI report, the level of registration of births and deaths in the country in 2011 was 82.4% and 66.4% respectively. According to the Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969, which was amended in 2023, registration of all births and deaths is mandatory. As per Section 23(2) of the RBD Act, “negligence by the registrar in registering any birth or death” is punishable with a fine. The fine was enhanced to upto ₹1,000 from ₹50 in the amended Act.\nWho can register such events?\nUnder the Civil Registration System (CRS), controlled by the RGI, government hospitals have been entrusted with the responsibility of functioning as registrar. Private hospitals are supposed to report the events in their jurisdiction to the registrar so that certificates can be issued to the family.\nThe RBD Act empowers the RGI to take steps to coordinate and unify the activities of Chief Registrars who are appointed by State governments. The registration is performed by different departments in States. While in some States and Union Territories such as Assam, Chandigarh, Haryana, Lakshadweep, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Sikkim and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Health department is involved in all levels of registration, in other States like Kerala the registration is done by the panchayat department, while in Bihar the directorate of economics and statistics does it. According to the 2023 amendment to the RBD Act, the RGI shall maintain a database at the national level and it is obligatory that Chief Registrars and Registrars share the information with the Centre. According to the 2023 Act, which became effective October 1, 2023 all births and deaths in the country are to be digitally registered through Centre’s portal — the Civil Registration System.\nWhy through a centralised portal?\nEffective October 1, 2023, digital birth certificates became the single and only document to prove the date of birth for various services such as admission to educational institutions, government jobs, marriage registration among others. The data will be used to update the National Population Register (NPR), ration cards, property registration and electoral rolls. The NPR, first collected in 2010 and updated in 2015 through door-to-door enumeration already has a database of 119 crore residents. NPR is the first step to the creation of the National Register of Citizens, per the Citizenship Act, 1955. The updation of NPR is currently on hold as it is to be done simultaneously with the first phase of the next Census, which has been indefinitely delayed.\nWhat were other concerns of RGI?\nThe RGI said that it has been observed that some hospitals instead of registering the events wait for the relative of the baby or the deceased to approach them and only then, do they begin the process of registration. Instances have also been reported that some private hospitals don’t report birth and death events to the concerned registrar and advise the relatives to report it himself. The RGI said that some registrars do not take adequate measures for making the registration process citizen friendly, stressing that birth and death certificates need to be issued within seven days.\nWhat about the Vital Statistics of India report?\nThe report which depicts data regarding infant mortality, still-birth and deaths at the national level has not been published since 2020. Such data is used by the government in socio-economic planning, to evaluate the effectiveness of various social sector programs and also serves as the cornerstone of the public health system. The report is a compilation of all the vital statistics reports of State governments. States and UTs such as Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, Chandigarh, Mizoram, Goa, and Arunachal Pradesh have published their reports till 2022. The last published Vital Statistics Report for Kerala was in 2021 and Mizoram is the only State to have published the report in 2023.\nThe 2020 report published by the RGI said that the number of registered births has decreased from 2.48 crore in 2019 to 2.42 crore in 2020 — a decrease of about 2.4%. In the case of registered births, there has been a fall in the year 2020, in almost all States except Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh compared to 2019. The number of registered deaths increased from 76.4 lakh in 2019 to 81.2 lakh in 2020.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 08:30 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nText and Context\n/\nThe Hindu Explains\n/\ndeath\n/\nNational Register of Citizens",

            "title": "Why are ASHA workers protesting in Kerala? | Explained",
            "summary": "The story so far:\nFor over two months now, a section of Kerala’s 26,125-strong community of\nAccredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been on a day-night agitation on the streets\ndemanding better remuneration and retirement benefits. While the agitation gained much attention and was also raised in Parliament, the issues raised by the ASHAs remain unresolved.\nWhy are they protesting?\nASHAs in Kerala are given a monthly honorarium of ₹7,000 and a fixed incentive of ₹3,000. Depending on the area where they work (for example, the tribal belt), they also get additional incentives. The payment of the entire honorarium and incentives are dependent on them fulfilling certain work-related criteria. The honorarium is paid by the State while the incentives are paid by the Centre and State at a 60-40 ratio. The State government claims that Kerala pays one of the highest honorarium to ASHAs, whereas the incentives given to ASHAs by the Union government for various services has remained the same from the inception of the scheme. Kerala Health Minister\nVeena George’s statement that almost all ASHAs in the State are drawing anywhere from ₹10,000- ₹13,000 a month\nwas refuted by the ASHAs who pointed out that they received much less in reality because of the criteria linked to honorariums.\nASHA workers’ agitation in Kerala: A fight for survival\nWhat are the long term demands?\nIn Kerala, which has one of the highest minimum wage structures, and where daily wages for various jobs range anywhere from ₹700-₹1,200, ASHAs earn less than ₹250 daily. Though their immediate demands were the release of pending amounts due to them, they also demanded that the criteria linked to the honorarium be removed. Their main demand is to hike the honorarium to ₹21,000 a month so that they receive at least minimum wage (₹700 daily). They also sought a lump sum of ₹5 lakh on retirement. The ASHA scheme, when conceived in 2005, envisaged ASHAs as health volunteers rather than as a regular workforce. Hence they receive no fixed salary, no pension or other social security benefits. ASHAs point out that they would forever remain on the fringes unless they were made into a regular workforce.\nAlso read |\nAgitation to continue till wages raised, Kerala govt withdrew from talks: protesting ASHA workers\nWhat is the State saying?\nThe State Government has all along maintained that ASHAs come under the Union government and that it was entirely up to the Centre to change the fate of ASHAs by making fundamental changes in the scheme such as revising the incentive pattern and changing their employment status from non-paid “health volunteers” to a regular workforce. The State has also called out the Centre for refusing to give the cash grant it owed to the State National Health Mission (NHM) for the year 2023-24 — ₹636 crore — which has precipitated the current crisis and totally derailed the functioning of the NHM. Though the Government issued orders de-linking the conditions which were attached to the honorarium payment, it has refused to relent to the ASHAs’ demand for a hike in honorarium or retirement benefits, citing the State’s precarious finances.\nASHA workers — the ongoing struggle for their welfare\nMoreover, the State government is peeved that the Kerala ASHA Health Workers’ Association (KAHWA) which is leading the agitation is doing so in front of the Secretariat and not in front of the Raj Bhavan. It has tried to discredit the agitation, accusing KAHWA of leading an “anti-government” movement.\nWhat is the current position?\nThe Union Health Minister has declared in the Rajya Sabha that the incentives for ASHAs would be revised, yet no timeframe has been fixed for the same.\nDuring the last round of negotiations, the State Government put forth a suggestion that a committee be set up to study the issues of ASHAs, including the honorarium hike. KAHWA suggested that in the interim, ASHAs be given a hike of at least ₹3,000 — an increase of ₹100 per day — which was rejected by the State.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 08:30 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nText and Context\n/\nThe Hindu Explains\n/\nKerala\n/\nhealth-workers union",

Viswanathan, so far, listed 10 petitions on the issue.\nWaqf (Amendment) Bill | Analysis and explainers from The Hindu\nIn addition to Mr. Owaisi’s plea, the court listed for hearing the petitions filed by\nAAP\nleader Amanatullah Khan, Association for the Protection of Civil Rights, Arshad Madani, Samastha Kerala Jamiathul Ulema, Anjum Kadari, Taiyyab Khan Salmani, Mohammad Shafi, Mohammed Fazlurrahim and RJD leader Manoj Kumar Jha.\nSeveral fresh pleas, which are yet to be listed, were filed in the top court subsequently including the ones filed by TMC MP Mahua Moitra,\nSamajwadi Party\nMP from Sambhal, Zia-ur-Rahman Barq.\nThe\nYSRCP\n-led by former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, the Communist Party of India (CPI), Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief and actor-turned-politician\nVijay have also moved the top court on the issue.\nAdvocate Hari Shankar Jain and one Mani Munjal have also filed a separate petition challenging the constitutional validity of several provisions of the law on the ground that they violate fundamental rights of non-Muslims following which the CJI agreed to list it.\nAnti-Waqf law protests will not be allowed: Assam CM\nThe Centre, on April 8, filed a caveat in the apex court and sought a hearing before any order was passed in the matter.\nA caveat is filed by a party in the high courts and the apex court to ensure that no orders are passed without hearing it.\nThe All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)\n,\nCongress\nMPs Imran Pratapgarhi and Mohammad Jawed are other key petitioners.\nOn April 7, a bench headed by the CJI assured senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, to consider listing the petitions.\nStates support the law\nIn a significant development, six BJP-ruled states including Madhya Pradesh and Assam have approached the Supreme Court to support the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.\nNew Waqf tribunal, board will aid Munambam residents: Rijiju\nThe six BJP-ruled states — Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Assam — have filed separate pleas highlighting the potential administrative and legal ramifications if the Waqf (Amendment) Act is struck down or altered.\nHaryana, which has filed the intervention in the lead petition, emphasised the urgent need for reform in the management of Waqf property.\nThe state government pointed to persistent issues such as incomplete property surveys, lack of proper accounting, long-pending cases in Waqf tribunals and irregular or missing records of property mutations.\nIt said the amended law seeks to bring a unified structure for Waqf management and ensure greater oversight of Mutawallis (custodians).\nThe Maharashtra government asserted that it is crucial to assist the apex court by providing parliamentary records, committee recommendations and insights from national consultations.\nIt also promised to share comparative frameworks of religious endowment laws across India along with empirical data highlighting misuse and lack of transparency in the Waqf administration.\nWhat the Waqf Bill means for madrassas and Muslim education | Explained\nAccording to the plea by Madhya Pradesh, the Waqf law aims to bring about significant reforms in the governance and regulation of Waqf properties.\nThe state emphasised that the law envisions a legally robust and technology-driven system that promotes transparency, accountability and socio-economic upliftment of intended beneficiaries.\nThe Rajasthan government raised concerns over past practices where properties -- whether privately owned or held by the state — were being declared Waqf assets without due process.\nThe new provisions, it said, correct this by mandating a 90-day public notice in two widely circulated newspapers before any such declaration.\nThis move, Rajasthan contended, ensures transparency and procedural fairness by giving affected stakeholders a chance to raise objections.\nChhattisgarh, in its plea, underlined the importance of simplifying administrative procedures and improving coordination between Waqf boards and local authorities.\nWhat are the key changes proposed in the new Waqf Bill? | Explained\nThe creation of a digital portal for Waqf property management, the state noted, will help in better tracking, identification and auditing of assets, ultimately strengthening transparency in financial practices.\nAssam's plea drew attention to Section 3E of the amended Act, which bars any declaration of land in Scheduled or Tribal Areas — covered under the Fifth or Sixth Schedule of the Constitution — as Waqf property.\nThe state pointed out that eight of its 35 districts fall under the Sixth Schedule and, thus, it has a direct stake in the outcome of the case.\nThe Uttarakhand Waqf Board, which has been supporting the Waqf (Amendment) Act, has also submitted an application in the Supreme Court seeking permission to intervene in the writ petition filed by Owaisi challenging the constitutional validity of the law.\nThe bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha with 128 members voting in favour and 95 opposing it. It was cleared by the Lok Sabha with 288 members supporting it and 232 against it.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 07:26 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nIndia\n/\nDelhi\n/\ncourt administration",

These comments show that the administration is not serious in addressing the core issues,\" Mr. Parande said.\nMr. Hakim had also called upon those protesting over the Waqf (Amendment) Act to channelise their agitation against the central government, “which was behind passage of the Act and hold protests in Delhi instead of targeting state properties and indulging in arson”.\nBlaming certain forces \"who want to polarise people of Bengal for political gains\", Hakim had asserted that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already spoken against the Act, and assured the Muslim community about her government's stand.\nParande also termed as “provocative” a recent statement by another West Bengal minister Siddiqulla Chowdhury that the protests against the Waqf Act will spread in the districts and then in Kolkata, and called for legal action against him.\nThese TMC leaders cannot escape responsibility for the \"attacks on Hindus in Dhulian, Suti and Shamsherganj of Murshidabad, which are condemnable to say the least\", he said.\nMr. Parande demanded deployment of central forces in certain sensitive parts of the state to save lives and properties.\nWishing people of the State on the occasion of Bengali New Year, he added: \"May peace, order and rule of law be established in West Bengal.

            "title": "Karnataka Gig Workers Bill: What stayed and what changed",
            "summary": "The Karnataka Cabinet, on April 11, cleared the much-awaited Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024, which is now expected to be introduced as an Ordinance. If passed, this would make Karnataka the second State in the country to introduce legislation for the welfare of platform-based gig workers after Rajasthan.\nWhy legislation?\nReports suggest that there are around 2 lakh platform-based gig workers in Bengaluru working with companies such as Swiggy, Zomato, Uber, Ola, Urban Company, Porter, Amazon, Flipkart and so on. An evolving and nascent sector, the gig economy is expected to create 23.5 million jobs in India by 2030 as per a 2022 NITI Aayog report.\nPlatform-based gig workers, who are not full-time employees and are often referred to as ‘partners’ by the aggregators, enjoy a certain degree of work flexibility unlike jobs in the formal sector.\nHowever, given the employment is outside the traditional employer-employee relationship, workers do not have the safety of labour protection laws. Multiple instances of worker neglect and exploitation have been reported over the years necessitating the need for legislation to ensure the protection and welfare of the workers.\nAlthough the Central government, in 2020, passed the Code on Social Security (CoSS) which defined gig workers for the first time in India, it is yet to be implemented. In 2023, the Congress government which was then in power in Rajasthan enacted the Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act, 2023 just before the state elections. The subsequent BJP government in the State left the law unimplemented.\nNEW DELHI, 09/04/2022: Blinket Delivery agent on way to deliver grocery in New Delhi on Saturday, April 09, 2022. Photo: R. V. MOORTHY / The Hindu\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                MOORTHY RV\nWhat’s the timeline?\nIt was in June 2024 that the Siddaramaiah-led government first published the draft of the Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill. According to officials, the Bill was drafted after several meetings with various stakeholders.\nWhile it was expected to be tabled in the monsoon session, industry bodies such as NASSCOM and IAMAI representing various tech companies registered strong opposition against several clauses of the draft Bill and demanded more time to submit their feedback. Following this, the draft Bill was put on the back burner, much to the dismay of gig worker unions, who have since been pushing for its passage at the earliest.\nIn the first week of April, the top brass of the Karnataka government met with Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, with whom the Bill was discussed. Legislation for gig workers was one of the promises of Congress before the general elections as well as the state elections in Karnataka. Following the meeting, Karnataka Labour Minister Santosh Lad confirmed that the Bill had been finalized and would soon be passed. On April 11, the Karnataka Cabinet cleared the Bill.\nWhat are the key clauses?\nThe Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers Bill defines a gig worker as a person who performs work or participates in a work arrangement that results in a given rate of payment, based on the terms and conditions laid out in such contract and includes all piece-rate work, and whose work is sourced through a platform, in the services specified in the Schedule - I.\nThe Bill that emphasizes the rights of gig workers aims to create a welfare fund for the workers, places obligations on aggregators, and proposes a welfare fee of 1%-5% of the payout to the worker during each transaction. All sum received will go to the welfare fund for the workers.\nA gig workers’ welfare board will be established to ensure registration of workers by the platforms, welfare fee collection, and implementation of social security schemes. Aggregators are required to furnish their database of all gig workers to the board.\nThe proposed Payment and Welfare Fee Verification System (PWFVS) will track every payment made to the workers and the welfare fee deducted by the aggregators.\nHow does the Bill help?\nThe platforms are required to provide a work environment that is safe and without risk to the health of the worker and ensure that the worker has adequate periods of rest and access to sanitary and rest facilities.\nAddressing arbitrary termination, which has been one of the major concerns of workers, the Bill notes that no worker can be terminated without a valid written reason and prior notice of 14 days, except in instances where they have caused bodily harm.\nThe Bill also mandates platforms to enter into transparent and fair contracts with the workers and stresses on the need for transparency with respect to the automated monitoring and decision-making system.\nIt proposes a two-tiered grievance redressal mechanism wherein the worker is required to approach the internal dispute resolution committee first. If the committee fails to provide an ‘Action Taken Report’ in 14 days or the worker is unsatisfied, the grievance will be forwarded to the board.\nBENGALURU   KARNATAKA   14/12/2022 :    Gig workers employeed by Food delivery service platforms Zomato and Swiggy, on their way to delivery of food to the customer at home, at Jalahalli cross, in Bengaluru on December 14, 2022.

Hence, it was demanded that the bill align its definition of gig worker with that of CoSS instead of creating a parallel system which equates gig workers to full time employees.\nWhat were the reasons for objections?\nA note from the IT-BT department argued that the welfare fee on a per-transaction basis was not suitable for all business models. It contended that the fee must be 1-2% of a platform’s state-specific turnover or 5% of gig workers’ payout, whichever is lower. To avoid duplicate obligations for platforms to contribute to both state and central funds, it also demanded a sunset clause or transition mechanism that addressed this issue once CoSS was implemented.\nThe previous version of the Bill proposed a grievance redressal mechanism under the Industrial Disputes Act. This was strongly opposed citing that the Act was applicable only to workmen covered under conventional labour laws.\nClarity on welfare fund utilisation was sought, and objections were raised to the central transaction information and management system (CTIMS), citing the compliance burden on platform companies. The draft Bill’s demand for platforms to disclose their algorithmic decision-making process was also opposed, contending that the anonymised nature of it was their competitive edge.\nThere were also objections regarding the 14-day notice period for workers before termination.\nCommerce and industries department argued that wide ranging powers to the state government allowing it to interfere with the algorithms, contracts and day to day management of platforms was against the spirit of ease of doing business.\nWhat were the changes made?\nFollowing the objections, a few amendments were made to the draft Bill.\nThe grievance redressal mechanism was removed from the ambit of the Industrial Disputes Act, and criminalisation for non-compliance was ruled out. While the Bill retained the 14-day notice period, a provision was added that it was not required in situations where bodily harm was caused.\nThe Bill gave more clarity regarding the welfare fee compared to the initial draft which was ambiguous regarding the deductions.\nIn its response to the objections made, the labour department noted that rules would be framed separately for platforms, taking into consideration sector-specific business models and without disturbing financial sustainability, cross-subsidisation and job creation in the industry.\nIt also pointed out that a sunset clause was introduced to the Bill and platforms need not contribute to CoSS if they are already contributing under the state bill.\nRegarding the objection to CTIMS, the department argued that aggregators are already tracking and storing data at an individual level. CTIMS was changed to Welfare Fee Verification System (WFVS), which only requires integration with the API and no additional compliance, it said.\nThe Bill adhered to its definition of ‘gig worker’ noting that it assumed employer-employee relationship only to the extent of providing basic minimum social security benefits and clarified that traditional labour laws do not apply to the sector.\n“Although there is flexibility of work for workers, platforms enter into contracts, define their payout, allocate and control work and in some cases provide benefits and insurance. So, ethe mployer-employee relationship exists to an extent. The bill addresses this unique nature of evolving relationships in the labour market by using a definition of Gig worker without establishing any explicit partnership status,” noted the response from Labour Department.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 06:33 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nbengaluru\n/\nKarnataka\n/\nhealth-workers union",

            "summary": "Andhra Pradesh Home Minister V. Anitha has accused the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) of hatching conspiracies to incite religious tensions in the State.\n“The YSRCP is resorting to deceptive strategies to disturb public peace. The sole aim is to incite religious clashes. The party is running malicious campaigns against the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to smear its reputation and tarnish the image of the government,” the Home Minister told the media after the State Cabinet meeting at the Secretariat on Tuesday.\nReferring to the death of Hyderabad-based Pastor Praveen Pagadala in Rajamahendravaram recently, Ms. Anitha alleged that the YSRCP tried to use the incident to provoke religious tensions.\n“Though the Pastor died in an accident, the YSRCP launched a misinformation campaign, portraying it as a murder,” the Home Minister said.\nMs. Anitha criticised TTD former Chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, saying that it is unfortunate that the person who once held such a post was now dragging the institution into politics.\n“TTD EO J. Syamala Rao has clarified the facts about the TTD and its Goshalas. Tirumala is a sacred place. The YSRCP leaders are using the TTD as a focal point to carry out their malicious campaigns.  Efforts to malign the TTD and tarnish the image of the government will not be tolerated,” she said.\nTirupati laddu row\nReferring to the Tirupati laddu controversy, Ms. Anitha said the SIT investigation would be completed soon, and those responsible would be punished. “Those who did wrong cannot escape. Punishment is inevitable,” she said.\nThe Home  Minister recalled that false propaganda was spread earlier regarding the pink diamond. Even though the Archaeology Department said otherwise, false narratives were still doing the rounds, she said.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 05:10 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nAndhra Pradesh\n/\nYuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party",

            "title": "Complete autonomy for States will weaken country, says BJP",
            "summary": "The demand for complete autonomy for States would weaken the country and hence was not justified, not right and unacceptable, BJP legislator Nainar Nagenthran said in the Assembly on Tuesday.\nHe led his party MLAs to stage a walk out, opposing Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s announcement in the Assembly of the formation of a high-level committee to study Centre - State relations. The AIADMK, BJP’s ally was not present in the House, as it had walked out over another issue.\nDuring his speech, Mr. Nagenthran said the demand for complete autonomy for States would weaken the country and instead the issue could be resolved in platforms such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council. Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan clarified on the percentage of devolution mentioned by the BJP legislator. The Minister also pointed out that the cess and surcharges remained outside the divisible pool.\nPointing out that the GST Council had one-third of the votes and all the States together had two-thirds of the votes and among themselves, they all have equal voting share irrespective of their population, Mr. Rajan contended that GST Council could not be taken for a classic example for federalism.\nTo Mr. Nagenthran’s contention that the idea of the GST Council was by the erstwhile Congress government, Congress leader K. Selvaperunthagai contended though his party was for rolling out GST but not in the present form, where equipment for the Intensive Care Unit and those used by disabled persons were also being levied the GST. Rejecting Mr. Nagenthran’s contention the NEET was rolled out during the Congress government, Mr. Selvaperunthagai said it was due to a Supreme Court judgment in a case moved by Sankalp Charitable Trust.\nAs for Mr. Nagenthran’s contention of late ‘Babasaheb’ B.R. Ambedkar’s comments against State autonomy, VCK MLA S.S. Balaji raised a point of order and clarified that the late leader supported State autonomy. “Mr. Nagenthran spoke as if late leader Ambedkar did not support the State autonomy. In fact, Annal Ambedkar had submitted a report to the Simon Commission on May 17, 1929 in which he supported State [then provincial] autonomy,” Mr. Balaji pointed out.\nTo another contention made by Mr. Nagenthran that late Ambedkar did not support the linguistic division of States, DMK MLA N. Ezhilan raised a point of order. Though late Ambedkar initially opposed the division of States along linguistic lines, he eventually changed his stand after reading the Report of the States Reorganisation Commission, Mr. Ezhilan said.\nThanking members those spoke following his announcement, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin accepted a request of Mr. Selvaperunthagai that the speech by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi over the State autonomy in 1974 be printed again and distributed to members. “My only regret is that the AIADMK, which is the principal opposition has not taken part in the proceedings and given its opinion. Be it AIADMK founder Makkal Thilagam [former CM] MGR or [former CM] Ammaiyar Jayalalithaa, despite their differences with the DMK, they extended their supported to protect the rights of Tamil Nadu.”\n“But we don’t know what the situation is now. We can understand it. But they will say that their principles were different from their alliance. Is this your principle? That is the question that needs to be asked,” Mr. Stalin said. In view of the rights of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Stalin placed a demand before the AIADMK: “Let us all come together to protect the rights of Tamil Nadu by going beyond the political affiliations and work together as a team. I hope that they will do this.”\nDuring his speech, Leader of the House and Minister Duraimurugan contended though the erstwhile Union governments sanctioned funds despite the demand for State autonomy and other stands to the States, the Union government was increasingly developing “imperialist” mindset and was not sanctioning funds if States had other views. The DMK that started advocating State autonomy was continuing to do so even after 50 years, he said.\nEOM\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 04:10 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nTamil Nadu\n/\nBharatiya Janata Party",

            "summary": "Andhra Pradesh HRD Minister Nara Lokesh on Tuesday complimented the State-level toppers from Government Junior Colleges in the Intermediate Public Examination-2025 ‘for upholding the dignity of public education’.\nAddressing 52 students who emerged as State-level toppers from government junior colleges, and their parents at a programme ‘Shining Stars-2025’ at Undavalli, the Minister said, “You all have shattered the stereotype that students from government colleges cannot score high marks”.\nThe young achievers were awarded gold medals and gifted laptops at the event.\nMr. Lokesh said the government was keen on upgrading the government schools and colleges to enable the students studying there to compete with their peers in private institutions.  “The government is trying to ensure that poverty does not become a barrier to education,” he said.\nHe pointed out that the re-introduction of the midday meal scheme in government junior colleges was aimed at encouraging students from economically backward sections to continue their education.\nSharing his own story, Mr. Lokesh said though during his initial student days, he was playful, he took his 10th Class exams seriously, worked hard in Intermediate, pursued an MBA course from Stanford and worked at the World Bank.\nThe Minister pointed out that girls outnumbered boys among the toppers and said in a lighter vein, “In studies and business, Brahmani (his wife) is better than me”.\nHe said the government would support the students through reimbursement and by finding alternatives even for their studies abroad.\nMr. Lokesh said students should not forget the sacrifices their parents make to see them succeed in life.\nHe said after Intermediate, students should choose a field that interests them. “IT is not the only career path. Students have diverse options. Today, the government has approved a solar cell manufacturing company. Solar energy plants are coming up in Nellore and Anakapalli. Reliance company has set up a compressed biogas plant in Kanigiri. Choose the sector that aligns with the changing times,” he said.\nStating that the government schools and colleges would be developed further, Mr. Lokesh said the government was taking seriously the suggestions that uniforms should be provided to Intermediate students.\nThe HRD Minister said instead of being job seekers, students should aim to become job creators. “No matter how high you rise, always stay grounded. Congratulations on your achievement, I am truly proud of you,” he said.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 03:50 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nAndhra Pradesh",

However, commission sources said that by the time survey was completed, it had the list of 1,821.\nExplaining the increase, sources said that these new castes were of those who had migrated to Karnataka from other States. “A column to mark new castes had been given to enumerators. The new castes have been identified here and many of them could belong to backward classes in their States.”\nA few names included Solanki, Sood, Punjabi Jat, and so on. Interestingly, many identified themselves by their language or State such as Odia, Malayalam, Gujarati, Rajasthani, Punjabi, Nepali, and others.\nThere were also 398 caste names that could not be identified specifically. These constitute 3,750 individuals from 965 households, forming 0.006% of surveyed population.\nHow many minorities?\nAbout 91 lakh people out of the 5.98 crore (15.19% covered under the survey) belong to minority communities, in which Muslims and their 101 sub castes form the biggest chunk at 76.99 lakh or about 12.87% from about 15.37 lakh households surveyed.\nChristians and their 57 sub sects are the second largest minority group with a population of 9.47 lakh from about 2.4 lakh households.

            "summary": "Accusing Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of trying to use the caste census report to divert public attention from the tussle over the chief ministerial post, the Opposition BJP on Tuesday put out 12 posers to him, including whether he was using it to prevent transfer of power to Deputy Chief Minister D. K. Shivakumar as per the reported power-sharing pact.\nIn a statement here, Leader of Opposition in the Assembly R. Ashok alleged that the Congress leaders themselves were of the view that the caste census report was being taken up to put Mr. Shivakumar in a tight spot.\nMr. Ashok maintained that there was a speculation within the Congress that the Chief Minister was trying to divert public attention as he was reportedly pulled up by the Congress high command during his recent Delhi visit on various issues, including the row over honey-trap allegations.\n“We want to reiterate that the BJP is not against taking any measures for the uplift of oppressed communities. But we are opposed to any political game plan for using these communities as pawns for revival of individual political fortunes after being met with setbacks,” he said.\nClaiming that the caste census report was “unscientific”, incomplete and irrelevant, Mr. Ashok said he was posing a slew of questions in that context. One of his questions was whether it was true that secretary of the commission had not signed the caste census report.\nAmong the other posers were: Is it true that the original report was missing though it had been kept in a sealed box? Why was the Kantharaju Commission report not accepted by Mr. Siddaramaiah in 2018 itself? Why the hurry for implementing this report the survey for which was conducted 10 years ago without visiting the houses of a large number of people? Is this survey still relevant?”\nQuestions were also raised on why the report was being taken up “suddenly” for discussion in the Cabinet without making efforts in the last 22 months to bring about a consensus, though Mr. Shivakumar and veteran Congress leader Shamanur Shivashankarappa had opposed it.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 03:30 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nKarnataka",

            "summary": "India can target $ 25 billion exports in the next 10 years and generate 35 lakh jobs with 10% market share in power tools and 25% market share in hand tools, according to NITI Aayog’s report on “Unlocking $25+ Billion Exports: India’s Hand & Power Tools Sector,” which was released here on Tuesday.\nThe report noted that there is a transformative potential of hand and power tools industry for the country’s economic growth. The report also outlines a strategic path for the sector to enhance its global competitiveness and capture a larger share of the international market.\nThe global trade market for power and hand tools is currently valued at approximately $ 100 billion and is projected to reach around $ 190 billion by 2035. “Within this market, hand tools account for $ 34 billion and are expected to expand to $ 60 billion by 2035, while power tools, including tool accessories, represent $ 63 billion and are anticipated to surge to $ 134 billion, with electrical tools comprising the majority. China dominates global exports, holding about 50% of the hand tools market with $ 13 billion and 40% of the power tools market with $ 22 billion, whereas India has a smaller presence, exporting $ 600 million in hand tools (1.8% market share) and $ 470 million in power tools (0.7% market share),” the NITI Aayog said.\nThe report said India has the potential to capture a larger share of the global market, targeting $ 25 billion in exports over the next decade, which could create approximately 35 lakh jobs by achieving a 10% market share in power tools and 25% in hand tools. “Through fostering innovation, empowering our MSMEs, strengthening India’s industrial ecosystem, we can solidify the nation’s position as a reliable, high-quality global manufacturing hub. The potential rewards for Indian economy and its people are immense,” the report said.\nThe report also analyses the challenges which India may face, including a 14-17% cost disadvantage compared to China, driven by higher structural costs and smaller operational scale. “This disadvantage stems from elevated raw material costs, such as steel, plastic, and motors, as well as lower labour productivity due to higher overtime wages and restrictions on overtime hours. Furthermore, higher interest rates and logistics costs for transporting goods from inland states to ports further hinder India’s competitiveness in the global market,” the report said.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 03:09 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nexports",

Two nurses were also around, but they did not intervene, according to the complaint.\nAfter being discharged from hospital on April 13, she confided in her husband about the harassment and he, in turn, made a call to the Police Control Room. She later filed a formal complaint at the police station in this connection in the presence of her legal advisor.\nThe Gurugram Police said the victim’s statement was recorded before the Magistrate and the matter was under investigation.

            "summary": "The beneficiary list of 394 families of Thuruthy Colony in West Kochi who will be assigned units at the newly constructed apartment complex will be further vetted since it is over a decade old.\nThe project was initially envisaged under the Rajiv Awas Yojana, a project aimed at making the country slum-free, in 2011. A survey found over 1,000 potential beneficiaries before it was further whittled down to 755 during 2011-12. Eventually, 394 homeless families were found eligible.\n“The project received final sanction in December 2013. The Kochi Corporation was among the three Corporations in the State to be allotted the project and the only one to implement it. The beneficiaries will have to produce, among other things, the village officer’s certificate that they were indeed homeless before they are assigned apartment units,” said T.K. Asharaf, councillor, Kalvathy division.\nThe construction of the twin apartment complexes as part of the Thuruthy housing project has been completed. Shortly, the Chief Minister will inaugurate the twin towers. The actual assignment of the apartment units may take more time as the vetting process needs to be completed.\nThe Corporation built the first tower at an investment of ₹41.74 crore, while Cochin Smart Mission Limited built the second tower at a cost of ₹44.01 crore. The first tower with 11 floors and a built-up space of 10,796.42 sq.ft. has 109 apartment units of 300 sq.ft. each. Each unit comprises a dining-cum-living area, a bedroom, a kitchen, a balcony and two bathrooms. Besides, there are 81 parking slots, three elevators, lifts, and 180 sq. ft. and 800 sq. ft. open areas on the first and the 11th floors. It will also have a 105 KLD capacity sewage treatment plant. Provision has been made for an Anganwadi and 14 shops on the ground floor.\nThe second tower has 195 apartment units across 13 floors and a total built-up space of 10,221 sq. ft.

            "summary": "The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State government to follow scrupulously guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in 2014 regarding the deaths of accused persons in police encounters, in the Hubballi case. This was the case in which a 35-year-old man, who is accused of allegedly murdering a 5-year-old girl after sexually assaulting her, was shot dead while he was in police custody.\nA Division Bench comprising Chief Justice N.V. Anjaria and Justice K.V. Aravind issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed by People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), Karnataka.\nRaising doubts about police claims on the encounter death, the PUCL had sought preservation of body of Ritesh Kumar, a migrant worker from Bihar, while expressing apprehension that his body was likely to be cremated. The petitioner also pointed out the guidelines issued by the apex court in PUCL vs. State of Maharashtra, in 2014.\n‘Not well placed’\nHowever, the Bench termed as “not well placed” the petitioner’s claim that the dead body of the accused would be cremated, as the State Advocate General told the court that that body of an accused person, who dies in police encounter is permitted only to be buried as per the norm as the body may require to be exhumed for investigation at a later stage.\nThe A-G pointed out to the Bench that a First Information Report (FIR) has already been registered and the investigation has already been handed over to Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in terms of the apex court’s guidelines while making it clear that the government is bound to follow the apex court’s guidelines in this case.\nAlso, the A-G told the court that question of disposing the dead body does not arise in this case as the post-mortem was not done as the body is yet to be identified by his parents or any relatives as per the norm. The A-G also said that the authorities will preserve sample of parts of the body, if taken for analysis, for investigation purpose.\nMeanwhile, the Bench adjourned further hearing on the petition till April 24 while directing the government to set up a panel to conduct postmortem and videograph inquest as per the apex court’s guidelines.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 01:19 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT",

            "summary": "T\nhe relationship between the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala and the Governor has been more or less a tranquil affair during the past decades with two rare exceptions.\nIn the late 1980s, there was a face-off between the CPI(M) and the Governor during the two-year-long tenure of Ram Dulari Sinha, who was a former Union and State Minister from Bihar. The then ruling front locked horns with the Governor over the nomination of a few members to the Senates of the Kerala and Calicut universities of her choice, thereby ignoring the recommendations of the State government. The LDF took to the streets protesting against the Governor and even organised marches to the Raj Bhavan. Later, the LDF government also passed a resolution in the Assembly condemning her “autocratic acts”.\nSome of the young leaders of the Students Federation of India, who were at the forefront of those protests, later graduated in politics to become State Ministers in the second LDF government led by Pinarayi Vijayan, which again hit a collision course with Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan.\nThough Mr. Khan began his tenure as Governor by declaring that he wanted to help the State government, the relationship turned sour in no time. Both the Governor and the government toughened their positions on a series of issues concerning the State. At one point, the Chief Minister and the Governor even refused to acknowledge each other and exchange smiles, if not pleasantries, while attending public functions. The Governor also criticised the government at press conferences and challenged activists of the Students’ Federation of India, who protested against him on the streets, to confront him directly, and termed them criminals. When Mr. Khan was later appointed Governor of Bihar, the LDF government chose not to give him a ceremonial send-off.\nRajendra Vishwanath Arlekar, a former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker, was appointed the next Governor. He began his tenure on a cordial note with the government, even as litigation against the former Governor remained pending with the Supreme Court. Mr. Arlekar surprised everyone who was expecting the conflict between the Governor and government to continue by joining Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for a breakfast meeting at Kerala House in New Delhi recently.\nHowever, a recent landmark judgment of the Supreme Court has come at the most inopportune time for both the Governor and the State government. Declaring Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi’s prolonged refusal to give his assent to 10 Bills as illegal and erroneous in law, the Court fixed a time frame for the Governors and the President to act on the Bills passed by the State Legislatures.\nKerala was one of the States that took the Governor to the Supreme Court. It had also set the legal and political circles of the State abuzz with its surprise decision to file an appeal in the Supreme Court after President Droupadi Murmu withheld assent for four Bills passed by the Kerala Legislature without disclosing any reasons.\nThe LDF government was quick to claim that the apex court has vindicated its stand on the issue by setting a timeline for Governors and the President to act on Bills, in the petition filed by Tamil Nadu, even though the Supreme Court is to consider its case only in May. However, it was caught by surprise when Mr. Arlekar gave an interview to the media terming the Supreme Court order as a judicial overstep. This has given rise to apprehensions that the bonhomie between the Governor and the government may not last long.\nHowever, the government has approached the situation with abundant caution and the Ministers who responded to the Governor’s statement were careful not to rub him the wrong way. They also appeared to have confined themselves to the questions of law discussed in the Supreme Court order and not cross swords with the Governor.\nIt is not yet time for the Kerala government to rejoice since a final verdict on the issues raised by it will be taken up by the Supreme Court only next month. Also, there is apprehension that the Court may refer the case to a Constitution Bench. This means that the government will have to handle the current situation with extreme caution.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 12:56 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\nKerala\n/\nGovernor",

The department referred to an instance where some students glorified slain forest brigand Veerappan by displaying a T-shirt with his photo at an annual day event in Krishnagiri district recently.\nThe students of Soppanur Government High School danced to a movie song and also wore clothes representing a political party. This led to parents of other students expressing their displeasure and also refusing to send their wards to school.\nSome of them lodged complaints with the authorities concerned, sources in the School Education Department said. In a communication sent to Chief Education Officers (CEO) of all districts last week, the Director of School Education said that the issue of students showcasing caste sentiments had resulted in a backlash in the form of complaints from the public.\nPlaying movie songs or allowing students to wear any symbol that might represent a community should not be allowed.\nIn case such complaints were received, disciplinary action would be taken against the headmaster and teachers.\nCEOs were also informed that the State Government had sanctioned ₹15 crore for conducting annual day programmes in government schools to promote the literary and cultural talents of students. There have been a number of instances where school students wore wristbands or ribbons to show their caste identity.\nThe Tamil Nadu Fifth Police Commission report also asked the Education Department to be sensitive to caste discriminatory practices in government and government-aided schools where the problem was acute.\nThe report said the government had banned wearing of caste-related colour wristbands or ribbon by the students and recommended that caste-neutral white or black ribbons may be permitted uniformly across the State.\nSchools that were prone to caste discrimination should not have many teachers belonging to the dominant community.\nThe police commission went on to recommend that tough action be taken against teachers who promoted caste discrimination by transferring them to far off places.\n“Headmasters and teachers have an onerous and profound responsibility in guiding the children in the right direction. All government and government-aided schools may be brought under the coverage of an extensive CCTV network to identify students who bully other students,” the report said.\nPublished\n- April 16, 2025 12:55 am IST\nRead  Comments\nCopy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\nREAD LATER\nRemove\nSEE ALL\nPRINT",

Soan Sarpanch Tirukkovela Vinod Kumar told\nThe Hindu\non Tuesday that the younger brother of Premsagar reportedly received a call from Dubai informing him about the incident.\n“Sandeep came to me and informed that his brother and two others have been badly injured in a fight with a co-worker at the bakery.

The Motorola Moto Buds+ earbuds\nalso include this feature\n.\nOtherwise, the Method 360 ANC earbuds seem like a solid entry in a crowded field. They offer ANC, multipoint connections, custom EQ options, wear detection and other bells and whistles. The battery lasts around 10 hours per charge, which increases to 40 hours when considering the charging case. However, this metric is with ANC turned off. There is a quick-charge feature that advertises two hours of use on just ten minutes of charging. This charging case includes an O-ring, so it can be clipped to stuff, and is available in several colors.\nSkullcandy\nThe earbuds ship with multiple sets of eartips that also use technology by Bose to ensure a “secure, ultra-comfortable fit and superior noise isolation.” They integrate with the Skull-iQ app, for making EQ adjustments, reconfiguring buttons and changing ANC modes. The Method 360 ANC earbuds are available right now at an introductory price of $100.

The FTC argues that the company's purchases of Instagram (for\n$1 billion in 2012\n) and WhatsApp (for\n$19 billion in 2014\n) hurt competition. If the trial goes the FTC's way, it will likely ask the judge to break up Meta by selling off one or both of the apps.\nLast April, Meta\nmoved to dismiss the case\n, but US District Judge James Boasberg\nallowed it to proceed\nwith a narrower scope.\nOn the stand on Tuesday, the Meta CEO reportedly defended the company's Instagram purchase as the result of a standard cost-benefit examination. \"We were doing a build-vs.-buy analysis,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I thought that Instagram was better at that [than Facebook's Camera app], so I thought it was better to buy them.\"\n\"Building a new app is hard,\" he said when asked on the stand why he was intent on buying Instagram. \"We’ve probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company, and the majority of them don’t go anywhere.\"\nOther details that came to light on Tuesday include a 2013 email in which Zuckerberg told executives to block Asian competitors Kakao and WeChat from advertising on Facebook. \"Those companies are trying to build social networks and replace us,\" he wrote. \"The revenue is immaterial to us compared to any risk.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/mark-zuckerberg-predicted-metas-antitrust-trial-in-a-2018-email-205719635.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "With America's long-term (and even short-term) economic prospects shifting on\nEric Cartman-like\nwhims\n, some internet providers have begun offering multi-year price guarantees to provide a little stability amid the chaos. A couple of weeks after Verizon\nintroduced a three-year price lock\n, Comcast has\nfollowed suit\nwith a five-year pricing guarantee for new Xfinity residential customers.\nOn the bright side, the deal isn't linked to an annual contract requirement. Comcast says that the following plans are available to be used with the five-year guarantee (speeds listed are download speeds):\n400Mbps – $55/month\n600Mbps – $70/month\n1.1Gbps – $85/month\n2.1Gbps – $105/month\nThis plan includes unlimited data and a free rental of the Xfinity Gateway router — but if you want to bring your own hardware, unlimited data will cost an extra $30 per month. And despite the fact that the Xfinity shopping page says these deals run through June 23, a Comcast spokesperson let us know they'll extend beyond that date.\nThe locked-in price doesn't cover installation, taxes, fees or other charges, which Comcast notes are subject to change during and after the promo. Finally, if you don't enroll in and maintain paperless billing and automatic payments, you'll pay an extra $10 each month (or an extra $8 if you pay by credit or debit card).\nAfter reading the fine print, you may find it amusing that Comcast's press release frames the price guarantee as being about simplicity. \"Our new price guarantee removes complexity,\" Comcast COO Steve Croney wrote. Still, with Americans increasingly being forced to check their 401(k)s and stock portfolios\nlike gamblers check a high-stakes sports score\n, any small oasis of financial stability is at least something.\nUpdate, April 15, 2025, 3:08PM ET:\nThis story and its headline were updated to provide additional details about the different plans and availability of Comcast's five-year guaranteed rates.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/comcast-rolls-out-a-five-year-price-guarantee-for-new-internet-customers-173421830.html?src=rss",

We don’t have many specifics, but we do know there’s an internal prototype that adds a social feed to ChatGPT’s image generation tool.\nIt remains unclear if OpenAI will launch this social network as a standalone app or if it will be integrated within the ChatGPT app, which is what the prototype indicates. The report does suggest that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been asking for feedback about the social network from people outside of the company.\nOne potential reason for this step is that the app would allow OpenAI to gather real-time data from users to train its AI models. It’s also a potentially diversifying move for the company.\nAlthough it’s uncertain if this project will ever see the light of day, one thing is probable — it’ll likely get under the skin of Elon Musk, who owns X. Altman and OpenAI have been at odds with Musk for some time. The company\nrejected his offer to buy OpenAI\n, instead offering to \"buy Twitter\" for just $9.7 billion dollars. It’s worth noting that the offer is four times lower than what Musk paid for the platform and that Altman purposefully used the word Twitter and not X.\nno thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want\n— Sam Altman (@sama)\nFebruary 10, 2025\nOpenAI has also\nrecently countersued Musk\n, accusing the billionaire of staging press attacks and malicious campaigns against the company on X. The suit also accuses Musk of making \"harassing legal claims,\"\nreferring to his initial suit\n, and a \"sham bid for OpenAI's assets.\"\nThe company also published an email from Musk’s time at OpenAI in which he suggested\nmerging with Tesla\n. Altman and his crew have stated that Musk was present during talks about OpenAI going for-profit and that he suggested he be given majority equity, control of the board and the CEO position. Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and founded xAI, which somehow\njust bought X\nin some kind of shady ouroboros of corporate tomfoolery.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-apparently-making-a-social-network-175842370.html?src=rss",

This chapter of the MOBA is themed Spirit Blossom Beyond, and it will bring a temporary new look to Summoner's Rift and several floral cosmetics for the champions. Season 2 will also involve some notable gameplay changes, as well as introducing an all-new game mode called Brawl.\nLoL\nis a perpetual balancing act, and the team at Riot have pared back the emphasis on early- and mid-game objectives this season so players can focus more on laning at the start of a match. Void Grubs are getting nerfed, with only one trio of grubs spawning per game. The reward for securing all three will be a single Void Mite to aid in your tower takes. Rift Herald has been slightly retuned, removing the Shelly's Gaze debuff to make the camp easier to solo.\nAtakhan is getting overhauled for Season 2. With this streamlined approach, he will only have one form that expands on the Bloody Petals mechanic introduced in Season 1. Killing the new Thornbound Atakhan will grant a team all remaining Bloody Petals that have spawned on the map with an increased buff amount. The team will also get a permanent buff for the rest of the match called Spiritual Purification: when an enemy is killed, opponents in the surrounding area will be slowed and take damage. Riot intended this Atakhan design to match the seasonal theme as well as nixing the unpopular mechanics like the team-wide Withdraw buff from the Voracious version of this new neutral camp.\nRiot Games\nAs the name implies, the new Brawl mode for\nLoL\nis all about fighting. It's a 5v5 matchup that removes much of the strategic burden from typical bouts, with no towers and only a handful of neutral buffs available to claim. Instead, teams score points by taking down enemy champions and by shepherding minions into the rival gate on a new map designed just for this mode. Riot is positioning these bite-sized, 10-minute matches as on-ramps for newer players still building their basic skills or as a mental break from the regular solo queue grind.\nAs with any big new content release, there are plenty of other tweaks to balance and quality of life that will be fully detailed in the patch notes.

            "summary": "A few years ago, I gave up on my Gmail inbox. I used to be meticulous. I would assign labels to every new email that came in, starring those that I wanted to find later easily. But between a job in journalism and way too much spam, the volume of new messages became unmanageable. And as of this article, I have more than 21,000 unread emails. After trying Notion's new email client, I might have a chance to reclaim my inbox.\nWith Notion Mail, Notion isn't trying to reinvent email. \"I feel like every email client has their own system, and many have a religious onboarding experience,\" Notion Mail Lead Andrew Milich tells me over video chat. \"You know, it's either keyboard shortcuts, a screening feature, a chatbox or something else. We tried to do something more lightweight.\"\nMilich knows a thing or two about rigid email apps. Before joining Notion, he was the co-founder of\nSkiff\n, a startup that offered, among other things, end-to-end encrypted email. Notion acquired Skiff at the\nstart of 2024\n. Since then, the Skiff team has been working on Notion Mail. For those keeping track, Notion Calendar was similarly born out of the company's\nacquisition of Cron\n.\n\"We want Notion Mail to stand alone as an email product you would love and want to use independent of Notion, but also one that every existing Notion user will find familiar and enjoyable,\" Milich says.\nTo that point, current Notion users will find much that's familiar. For instance, in the compose window there’s support for slash commands, code blocks and Markdown shortcuts. However, it's the new features Milich and his team created for Notion Mail that are what make the app interesting.\nNotion\nIt starts with two related tools: AI labels and views. The first time you open Notion Mail, the software will analyze your inbox and suggest personalized labels for broad categories of messages, and create corresponding folders where those emails will be automatically sorted. You can filter, group and sort emails independently within each view for added flexibility. If you ever want to create additional AI labels, a button at the top of the interface to do so quickly. Additionally, any labels you create through Notion Mail will be preserved in Gmail, and your data won't be used to train future AI models.\n\"We try to sync as much data as possible, so that means all these labels, even the ones that are applied by AI as the emails are received, get synchronized to Gmail too,\" Milich says, adding, \"we've deliberately moved drafts and sent lower and tried to focus users on the labeling, views and templates.\"\nThe final pillar of Notion Mail revolves around scheduling. Provided you've granted Notion Calendar access to your Google Calendar, you can insert booking links directly within the compose window by typing \"/schedule\". For the recipient, a single click will get them on your calendar.\nNotion\nOutside of those big features, Notion Mail offers the usual time savers you'll find in its competitors, including suggested replies, keyboard shortcuts and a built-in AI editor for drafting and editing messages. There's also a snippet library you can use to save yourself from writing the same section of text over and over again in different emails.\nIn the short time I've had with Notion Mail, I've noticed it's incredibly flexible. According to Milich, the app isn't designed to push users toward a goal like inbox zero that isn't obtainable (or really useful) in a modern context. Instead, he says his hope is that Notion Mail limits how much the act of managing your inbox drains your time, energy and attention, and so far I can say it has done exactly that.\nIf you want to try Notion Mail for yourself, Notion is making the client available to everyone, including free users, at no additional cost. You will only need to pay for the app if you frequently\nuse some of its AI features\n. At launch, it works with Gmail.  Milich says support for Outlook and iCloud is on the roadmap, but didn't share a specific date.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/notion-mail-is-a-powerful-but-lightweight-email-client-for-busy-people-150007543.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "4chan, the controversial forum known for birthing early meme culture and Gamergate, is down, following an apparent hack.\nPer Downdetector\n, reports of an outage began circulating late Monday evening, with users sharing updates on connection issues through the early hours of Tuesday morning. As of the writing of this article, it's possible to access the website following a long delay, but clicking on any of the board links leads to a timeout.\nAccording to\nscreenshots shared on Imgur\n(NSFW warning), it appears a hacker gained shell access to 4chan's hosting server. They then went on to post images of the site's phpmyadmin page, and appear to have doxed the entire moderation team alongside many of the site's registered users. While it seems some users took steps to protect their identities, many appear to have used their primary email address to register for the forum, with .edu and even .gov addresses reportedly appearing in the list leaked emails.\nIt's unclear what this means for the future of 4chan, but some\nsocial media\nand\nReddit users\nare speculating this could be the end of the internet's most infamous forum. In addition to doxing much of 4chan's userbase, the hacker also appears to have leaked the site's source code, revealing security holes that have existed since around the time Hiroyuki Nishimura bought the forum from creator Christoper Poole. It may take months to rebuild a more secure version of 4chan.\nIf this is the end of 4chan, it would be the most significant de-platforming of extreme right-wing internet users since Kiwi Farms temporarily\nwent down in 2022\n.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/4chan-the-internets-most-infamous-forum-is-down-following-an-alleged-hack-142516392.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "There's another development in the saga that is governments accusing Google of monopolistic practices favoring its search app and Chrome. The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has\nissued a cease and desist order to Google\n, demanding the tech company end all efforts to gain preferential treatment on Android phones.\nThe watchdog alleges that Google required phone makers to preinstall Chrome and Google Search on Android phones — along with setting Chrome as the default browser. It also claims they had to place the icons for each app on the home screen. This arrangement came due to the\ntech company's power\nas provider of the Google Play app ecosystem, which Android manufacturers need to install before distribution.\nHowever, the JFTC further claims that Google sweetened the deal, agreeing to give these phone manufacturers a slice of its ad revenue. As of last December, six Android phone manufacturers allegedly had these deals with Google. These arrangements have been ongoing since at least July 2020, if not earlier.\nThe JFTC's decision follows an investigation, opened in October 2023. It comes the same week as a Japanese delegation, led by Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa, will\nvisit the US to negotiate tariffs\n.\nThe US has expressed similar concerns to Japan. Last November, US federal judge Amit Mehta called Google \"\na monopolist\n\" within the search engine industry and called on the company to sell off Chrome. An\nevidentiary hearing\non the matter is set to begin later this month, with a trial commencing in May.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/japan-clamps-down-on-googles-android-app-pre-install-deals-130050220.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "At long last, NVIDIA has announced its budget GeForce RTX 50-series, but don't expect any major discounts over the previous models. The RTX 5060 will start at $299, just like the RTX 4060 did when it\nlaunched two years ago\n. Of course, it's unclear how many people will actually be able to nab it at that price, given the volatile nature of the GPU market and further fluctuations from the\nTrump administration's sloppy tariff deployment\n.\nNVIDIA is also launching two variants of RTX 5060 Ti GPUs with 8GB and 16GB of VRAM, priced at $379 and $429, respectively. (16GB of RAM in the 5060 Ti and only 12GB in the RTX 5070? What gives NVIDIA?) Those faster GPUs will arrive on April 16, but we don't have a firm date for the RTX 5060 besides a vague May release.\nWhile NVIDIA touts the typical performance improvements, the real selling point of the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti will be their full support of DLSS 4 upscaling and 4X multi-frame generation. In my reviews of the\nRTX 5070\n,\n5070 Ti\nand\n5090\ncards, I was surprised how much DLSS 4 boosted frame rates while still delivering excellent image quality. But it'll be interesting to see if that technology will see much benefit from slower cards like the 5060 and 5060 Ti.\nNVIDIA\nCuriously, NVIDIA isn't divulging full specs for all of these GPUs just yet, even though\nplenty of early details have already emerged\n. Officially, the company says the RTX 5060 is powered by 8GB of GDDR7 VRAM, 19 TFLOPS Blackwell shader cores, 5th-gen tensor cores with 614 AI TOPS performance and 4th gen RT (ray tracing) cores that can hit 58 TFLOPS. Unofficially, reports claim it also has 3,840 CUDA cores. In comparison, the RTX 4060 had 3072 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM.\nThe RTX 5060 Ti steps things up to 4,608 CUDA cores and the aforementioned 8GB and 16GB GDDR7 RAM options. NVIDIA says its Blackwell shader cores offer 6 TFLOPS more performance than the 5060, which should be plenty noticeable in typical gameplay. The RTX 5060 is mostly a 1080p-focused card, while the RTX 5060 Ti is far better suited to 1440p gameplay — as long as you don't need obscene framerates.\nAccording to NVIDIA's benchmarks, the RTX 5060 can reach 234 fps in\nHogwarts Legacy\nwhile playing in 1080p with maxed out graphics settings and 4X frame-generation. The RTX 4060, in comparison, hits around 110 fps with 1x frame generation. NVIDIA claims the 5060 can also reach 148 fps in\nCyberpunk 2077\n, 220fps in\nAvowed\n, and 330 fps in\nMarvel Rivals\nin 1080p with the same graphics settings and frame gen. It could be the perfect card if you're rocking a 240Hz 1080p screen.\nAs for the RTX 5060 Ti, NVIDIA says it can reach 108 fps in\nCyberpunk\nwhile playing in 1440p with Full RT graphics settings and 4X frame generation. That's double the 4060 Ti, which reached 52 fps with 1x frame generation. Even when native performance is solid, NVIDIA also says DLSS 4's transformer upscaling model can improve overall image quality and latency. The 5060 Ti can reach 61 fps and 70ms latency in\nHogwartz Legacy\nnatively, but the latency drops to 47ms with DLSS 4 enabled (which also pumps up the frame rate to 171 fps).\nAs usual, a scaled down version of the RTX 5060 is also headed to laptops, which NVIDIA says will start at $1,099. We don't have specs for that hardware either, but the company claims it'll be able to reach 146 fps in\nCyberpunk 2077\nwhile playing in 1080p with ultra graphics settings and 2X frame generation. In comparison, the mobile RTX 4060 reached 60fps with those settings, and it was also limited to 1x frame generation.\nThe real challenge for NVIDIA with the GeForce RTX 5060 family lies in pricing. The company doesn't directly control how OEMs price their cards, and numbers could also fluctuate wildly depending on stock and economic conditions. So sure, the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti sound compelling for their price, but it remains to be seen if those figures are actually realistic for consumers. And it'll be interesting to see how AMD responds with cheaper new GPUs, after its\nRadeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards\nwalloped NVIDIA's current mid-range options.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-geforce-rtx-5060-gpu-starts-at-299-rtx-5060-ti-at-379-130020340.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "Chromebooks have become a go-to choice for students, casual users and anyone who wants a simple, fast and affordable laptop. Powered by Google’s lightweight ChromeOS, these devices are great for web browsing, streaming, word processing and using popular apps like Google Docs or Zoom. Whether you need something for school, work or everyday use, the best Chromebook can offer solid performance, long battery life and a surprisingly premium experience — all without breaking the bank.\nWith so many models to choose from, finding the best Chromebook depends on what you need most: a bright display, solid build quality, tablet-style 2-in-1 features or just the lowest price possible. Here, we’ve collected our top picks for the best Chromebooks you can get right now, all of which have a combination of the most important features anyone would be looking for.\nTable of contents\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus\nAcer Chromebook Plus 514\nAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\nAcer Chromebook Plus 516 GE\nChromebook FAQs\nOther Chromebooks we tested\nBest Chromebooks in 2025\nChromebook FAQs\nWhat is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?\nThis is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome's operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly.\nOf course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup.\nGoogle and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google\nadded video editing tools\nto the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced\nPhotoshop on the web\nlast year, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks.\nChromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser.\nWhat do Chromebooks do well?\nPut simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.\nAs I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your\n2-in-1 laptop\nto use mobile data.\nGoogle continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.\nIf you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of the Google One AI Premium plan — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini Advanced (which runs on the 1.5 Pro model) and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts.\nAs for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.\nFinally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to\nmake Chromebooks with cloud gaming\nin mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop.\nWhat are the most important specs for a Chromebook?\nChrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the\nChromebook Plus initiative\n. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the\nbest laptop\nthey can use every day.\nChromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen.\nOf course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience.\nGoogle has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date.\nThis support page\nlists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.\nHow much should I spend on a Chromebook?\nChromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the\nbest Windows laptops\n, or even the best “regular” laptops out there.\nThere are plenty of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough.\nSee Also:\nBest Laptops for 2025\nBest Gaming Laptops\nBest 2-in-1 Laptops for 2025\nBest Cheap Windows Laptops\nBest Laptops for College Students\nOther Chromebooks we tested\nSamsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus\nSamsung’s new\nGalaxy Chromebook Plus\nis one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss",

            "title": "The best smart plugs in 2025",
            "summary": "I recently moved and, before I had a chance to set up my smart plugs again, I found myself turning on my living room lamps manually — I sort of hated it. Reaching, twisting and visiting each one like some Victorian gaslighter felt almost silly to me after having experienced the ease of asking Alexa to “turn on all the lights.” True, there are worse problems, but like all smart home stuff, smart plugs simply make life a bit more convenient and, honestly, a little more fun.\nIn the two years or so that I’ve been testing smart plugs, I’ve come across models that were just plain bad and others that were pretty good. I like\nTP-Link’s EP25\nbest of all, but a few others have their advantages — outdoor use, energy monitoring, dual outlets, Matter compatibility — that might make those options better for you. Here are our top picks for the best smart plugs you can buy, along with how to get the most out of your plug once you buy it.\nTable of contents\nBest smart plugs for 2025\nBest outdoor smart plugs for 2025\nWhat to consider when buying a smart plug\nHow we tested the best smart plugs\nOther smart plugs we tested\nSmart plug FAQs\nBest smart plugs for 2025\nThe best outdoor smart plugs for 2025\nMost people will likely use outdoor plugs for two things: patio lighting and holiday string lights. The devices are designed for the outdoors with a weatherproof protection rating of IP64 or higher, which means they’re impervious to dust and can handle splashing water from rain and sprinklers. They have a longer Wi-Fi range than indoor plugs, for obvious reasons, and many have dual outlets, with individual control over each one.\nSetup is the same as for indoor plugs: you’ll use your phone to help the plug find your Wi-Fi using its companion app. The only tricky part is getting your phone within Bluetooth range of the plug (which it uses to initialize setup)\nand\nin Wi-Fi range at the same time. I had to awkwardly stand at a triangulated point in the middle of my driveway to get things communicating properly. Once set up, the plugs will communicate using your router for voice and app control and your phone needn’t be anywhere near the plug.\nWhat to consider when buying a smart plug\nBefore you buy one, it helps to know how a smart plug works best. They are designed for things that have an on/off switch, making them great for turning lamps into smart lights. If you want a plug-in fan to move some air around before you get home, a smart plug can help. You can load a basic coffee maker with grounds and water the night before and wake up to a fresh pot in the morning. And instead of an air purifier running all day, you could set it to just run when you’re away. But gadgets that needs to be programmed further, or requires a stand-by mode, isn’t ideal. If you want to control built-in lights, you’ll need a smart light switch, which are more involved than smart plugs as they can involve in-wall installation. Smart bulbs are also an option for automation, and we have an\nentire guide devoted to those\n.\nSome smart plugs can even monitor how much energy they use and display those figures within their companion app. That might not be much use on its own, as lamps with LED light bulbs consume very little energy, but it could help you keep tabs on your overall energy consumption.\nSetup and use\nAdding a smart plug to your home is relatively simple. You’ll use the manufacturer’s app to initially connect, after which you can add the plug to a compatible smart home ecosystem so you can use voice control and other features. Both the brand’s app and your smart home app will let you name the plug, set schedules and program “routines” which provide automation for multiple smart devices at once. But as you can guess, a manufacturer’s app only lets you control products from that brand. If you want whole-home automation, operating, say, a plug from TP-Link’s Kasa, a smart bulb from Philips Hue, a smart thermostat from Honeywell and a camera from Arlo without switching apps, you’ll need to use a smart home platform, which means you’ll need to consider compatibility.\nCompatibility\nSmart home devices connect through wireless protocols, often using more than one to communicate with your phone, smart speaker, router and in some cases, one another. The majority of smart plugs use Wi-Fi, but some have recently incorporated\nMatter\n, a relatively new wireless standard intended to solve integration issues between different brands and manufacturers, while also improving security and reliability.\nMore of these smart plugs are coming to market and, for now, most Matter devices work via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a low-power mesh network called Thread. Matter requires a controller that stays at home, like a hub or smart speaker, to manage things when you’re out and about.\nAs for Bluetooth, most plugs, including all Matter plugs, use the short-range protocol to get the device set up for the first time. Some can continue to run on Bluetooth in the absence of another option, but the connection isn’t as reliable and you won’t be able to control the plug when you’re away from home, or perhaps even just on the other side of the apartment.\nBecause Matter is relatively new, it may be easier to consider the manufacturer’s system you’d use the most. There are four major “branded” smart home platforms: Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, Apple’s HomeKit and Samsung’s SmartThings. The first two work with the widest range of brands and are compatible with both iOS and Android devices. HomeKit not only limits app access to Apple devices, but it’s also compatible with fewer plugs. You can also turn to open-source software like Home Assistant or go with the larger functionality of\nIFTTT\nif you want to, say, have your lights turn off when your Uber arrives. For the purposes of our testing, we stuck with the four big players. Nearly every plug we looked at clearly stated which platforms it works with, both on the packaging and retail product pages.\nOf course, there’s no rule that says you have to stick with one home assistant. You might have an Echo Dot in the basement, a HomePod in the living room and a Google Nest Mini in the kitchen, each controlling any compatible devices. My kid has a great time telling Alexa to turn on a light then asking the Google Assistant to turn it back off.\nPhoto by Amy Skorheim / Engadget\nHubs and smart plugs\nAll of our top picks recommended here don’t require a hub and connect directly to your home’s Wi-Fi router. That means if you already have wireless internet and a smartphone or tablet, you can quite literally plug and play. The exception is Apple’s HomeKit. If you want to pair up a compatible plug with that platform, you’ll need a HomePod speaker, Apple TV or an iPad that stays in your home to enable remote control when you’re away.\nSome smart plugs require a hub regardless of which platform you use. For our guide, we focused on the simplicity (and lower cost) of options that work on their own, but hub-dependent devices may make sense in certain situations. Some companies, like Aqara for example, make a vast range of smart home products, adding automatic shades, window sensors, smart locks and air quality monitors to the more traditional cameras and plugs. If you’re going all-in on one brand and plan to get a plethora of connected devices, a hub can keep your Wi-Fi network from getting too crowded and provide a more seamless setup with reliable connectivity.\nSharing\nOnce a plug is set up with your platform and voice assistant of choice, anyone can control the plug just by talking. If someone else wants to control things with their phone, things get more complicated. Google makes it easiest, allowing you to invite another person just by tapping the + button within the Home app. Whomever you invite will have full access to your connected devices – including cameras – so this is only for people you trust the most.\nHomeKit makes it similarly easy to grant app access to someone else, but as with most things Apple, it only works for other iOS users. Amazon only allows you to share access to your Echo, not your connected home devices.\nMany smart plug manufacturers allow you to share control through their app by inviting another person via email. But this only grants access to devices of that brand. Hopefully as Matter expands, multi-admin features will become more widespread.\nIf you get a new Wi-Fi network\nMost people will wirelessly connect their smart plugs to their home’s Wi-Fi router. Matter, Z-Wave, Thread and other smart home protocols can work over local networks, but for most setups, the signals telling your plugs what to do will be dispatched through your router. If you happen to get a new one (like I did when it became clear my very basic gateway could not handle the number of smart home devices being tested) you’ll need to take a few steps to get everything reconnected.\nDepending on the brand, the steps may simply involve using the plug’s companion app to update your credentials (network name and password). Or it will require deleting the device in the companion app, doing a factory reset (typically by pressing the onboard button for 10 seconds) and setting up the plug like it's brand new. GE Sync and Emporia plugs allow for a credentials update via their apps, others, like TP-Link Kasa and Meross plugs require deletion and a factory reset to get along with your new network. Amazon’s smart plug updates automatically after updating the associated Echo device.\nHow we tested the best smart plugs\nBefore we decided which smart plugs to test, we considered brands Engadget staffers have had the best experiences with, both in review capacity and personally. We also checked out other online reviews. We then looked at factors like price, compatibility and relative popularity. I got ahold of ten indoor smart plugs and four outdoor versions from eight manufacturers.\nI set up each one using its companion app, then added it to all compatible smart home platforms. Plugging in a cadre of lamps and string lights, I tested the plugs using an iPhone 11, Galaxy S10e, Echo Dot, HomePod mini and Nest Mini. I accessed the plugs via the apps and through voice commands and controlled them in my home and away from it. I programmed schedules and routines and moved the plugs to different outlets, including ones in the basement to gauge range. For the outdoor devices, I plugged them into an outlet in the garage (approximately 85 feet from my Wi-Fi router) and an outlet attached to the back of the house.\nHere’s every smart plug tested before settling on our top picks:\nThe Amazon Smart Plug\nEmporia Smart Outlet\n*\nGE Cync Indoor\nWyze Plug\nRoku Indoor Smart Plug SE\nBelkin Wemo smart plug with Thread\nTP-Link Kasa EP25\nTP-Link Kasa Ultra Mini EP10\nMeross Wi-Fi Dual\nTP-Link Kasa KP125M\n(Matter)\nEve Energy\n(Matter)\nAqara Smart Plug\n(hub required)\nAmazonBasics Outdoor Smart Plug\n(outdoor)\nWyze Plug Outdoor\n(outdoor)\nTP-Link Kasa Outdoor EP40A\n(outdoor)\nTP-LINK Outdoor Dimmer KP405\n(outdoor)\n*Emporia issued a recall on its smart plugs purchased before August 1, 2023 due to a potential fire risk, though no incidents were reported. The plugs have since been updated to resolve the issue and are back on sale. We tested the revised version and recommend it as the energy-monitoring pick.\nAs new smart plugs are released, we'll continue to try them and update this guide accordingly. We plan to add smart power strips to this guide as well.\nOther smart plugs we tested\nMeross Matter plug (MSS115)\nI wasn’t able to test the Meross Matter plug fully. It requires Wi-Fi splitting, a process that’s certainly possible for the average consumer, but more involved than it should be, considering the more than dozen other plugs I’ve tested don’t require such a step. The plug itself also blocked the other outlet. Meross has an updated version of the Matter device on the way, one that looks to solve both issues and we’ll update this guide accordingly once we’ve had a chance to test it.\nRoku Smart Plug\nRoku’s smart home gear is basically Wyze equipment with an app and packaging that are more purple. The\nRoku smart plug\nperformed just fine with both compatible voice assistants (Alexa and Google Assistant). The companion app doesn’t offer scheduling that revolves around the timing of the sunset in your area, but the plugs go for less than $10 each and if you’ve got a Roku TV or streaming device set up and want to keep everything on-brand, it could be a fit.\nAquara Smart Plug\nThe\nAqara plug\nrequires an\nAqara hub\n. In tests, the connectivity was solid and the companion app allowed for useful if/then automations that can rope in other Aqara devices like locks, window shades, cameras and more. The plug also worked well with voice assistants from Amazon, Google and Apple. As a stand-alone plug, however, it’s tough to recommend the nearly $100 combo to anyone who isn’t planning to get a complete Aqara smart home setup.\nSmart plug FAQs\nWhat should you not plug into a smart plug?\nAnything with controls that are more complicated than on/off won’t work well with a smart plug. For example, a dimmable lamp with touch controls won’t turn on when the smart plug does. A programmable coffee maker, smart TV, microwave, Instant Pot, robot vacuum — none of these make sense to use with a smart plug as they all require further input from you to start working. Appliances like a lamp with a twist knob, a basic humidifier, a coffee maker with a red-rocker switch are all good options for using with smart plugs.\nYou’ll also want to pay attention to the wattage and amperage rating of your smart plug. All smart plugs work with 120V outlets, and most are rated to 15A, which should handle even power-hungry appliances like a 1500 watt space heater. But be sure to check that the plug can handle whatever you’re plugging in. It’s also not wise to use a smart plug to automatically turn on appliances that require supervision, like things with heating elements (heaters, curling irons, etc).\nWhat are the disadvantages of a smart plug?\nWhile they’re great when everything is working properly, smart plugs can be frustrating, adding a layer of complication to the simple act of turning on a light, if something goes wrong. For example: If your Wi-Fi goes out, your smart plug won’t work. If the smart plug loses its connection to your router, it won’t work. If you change your Wi-Fi password or provider, you’ll have to re-program your smart plugs. If you forget what you named a particular plug during setup, you may be faced with an irritating conversation with your voice assistant. The best way to avoid some of those problems is to get a plug that works reliably, which is one of the features we considered for this guide.\nHow much power does a smart plug draw?\nSmart plugs don’t draw much more power than whatever you’re plugging into them. True, they remain on standby to await instructions from your smart assistant or other controller, so they’re always using a small amount of power. But if, for example, you set a light to automatically turn off at night, and that light would otherwise stay on unnecessarily, the smart plug will save far more energy than the watt or two extra that it draws.\nDo smart plugs use Bluetooth?\nSome smart plugs use Bluetooth to connect to your phone during setup. After that, most connect to your home’s Wi-Fi network.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-plug-131542429.html?src=rss",

            "title": "Espresso 15 Pro review: Just a really nice (though pricey) portable monitor",
            "summary": "Espresso Displays makes some of our favorite\nportable monitors\n, but up until now, it felt like there was a hole in its portfolio. That's because aside from its flagship model — the $800 Espresso 17 Pro — the other members of the family are slightly more affordable fare like the $469 Espresso Touch 13 and $499 Touch 15. Today, the company is plugging that gap with the Espresso 15 Pro, which packs everything I like about its bigger sibling in a more portable package for $699 (with a stand included).\nDesign and display\nOne of the things I appreciate about Espresso is that it doesn't try to do too much. The 15 Pro features an ultra minimalist design made from simple sheets of matte black aluminum along with glossy glass in front (if you prefer matte displays, you can always add one of the company's textured\nscreen protectors\n). Granted, the monitor does have a bit of a chin, but aside from two USB-C ports stashed in the corner, that's really the 15 Pro's only defining exterior feature, so I'm not that bothered. All told, the display weighs 1 pound and 11 ounces, which sounds a lot heavier than it feels.\nAs for its specs, the Espresso 15 Pro's 4K LCD panel delivers nearly everything you want and then some. Brightness tops out at 550 nits (it was actually 556 nits according to my light meter), which is higher than the 450 nits on the 17-inch model. It also covers 100 percent of the Adobe RGB spectrum with 10-bit color (8-bit + 2-bit frame rate control). The one thing I wish Espresso included was a 120Hz refresh rate instead of being capped at 60Hz. That said, unless you're gaming or editing videos, that limitation may not be a huge factor.\nSetup and special features\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nGetting the 15 Pro up and running couldn't be easier. Each USB-C port has enough bandwidth to carry power and data over a single cable, so you just need to plug in the included cord, and off you go. The one exception is for laptops that can't send out much power via USB-C, but I tested the monitor with 4 different laptops (both Mac and PC) and none of them had issues. The display even automatically downloaded the EspressoFlow software, which adds touch support to your Apple notebooks. You also get the new Glide feature that automatically positions the monitor in the right place depending on how you have it arranged next to your laptop. And by some black magic, the 15 Pro nailed it when it correctly laid out the monitor to the left of my notebook's built-in screen.\nAs someone who has recently been forced to use a Mac for work, the ability to quickly and easily add touch support to Apple's laptop is super nice. And while I'm far from a digital Degas, you can even use the display for drawing and sketching as the monitor also works with the company's\noptional stylus\n. This makes the 15 Pro an ideal travel companion for both people who want more screen real estate or a portable way of creating art on the go.\nAccessories\nIn addition to screen protectors and pens, there are also a couple of important stand accessories for the 15 Pro. The first is the\n$49 Espresso Case\n, which is more of a magnetic folding cover that protects the screen while in transit that can also flip around back to become a kickstand when you're working. Like the display itself, it's a fairly simple affair that does exactly what you expect it to.\nHowever, for those who want something more substantial, the 15 Pro also works with Espresso's\n$69 Stand+\n. It's more like what you'd see on a traditional desktop monitor, except that it can fold up for improved portability while also packing a really strong magnet that allows you to mount the monitor in a variety of positions. This thing might be too pricey for some, but I've quickly grown to appreciate how easy it makes putting the 15 Pro in the perfect position. It's more well-built than a lot of the desktop monitor stands I have. The obvious drawback is that at 1 pound and 4 ounces, the Stand+ weighs almost as much as the display itself, which is rather hefty.\nWrap-up\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nThe Espresso 15 Pro has nearly everything I look for in a premium portable monitor. It features well above average brightness, a sleek but sturdy design and super simple setup. It also comes with a few special features like Glide and added touch support for Macs that help you get more out of the devices you already own. And thanks to a wealth of accessories, it can adapt to almost any use case.\nWhile I'd like a higher refresh rate, not having it is far from a deal-breaker. That would almost certainly increase its price, and considering that the 15 Pro is already somewhat costly, starting at $699 for the monitor and the Stand+, I'm not sure the added expense would be worth it. Regardless, if you want a really portable monitor that's also more than good enough to use at home, there aren't many other displays that can match the Espresso 15 Pro.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/espresso-15-pro-review-just-a-really-nice-though-pricey-portable-monitor-230046315.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "In a decision almost certainly informed by the recent tariff chaos, NVIDIA is going to start making some of its AI chips and supercomputers in the US.\nThe company announced\nthat it's building and testing its\nBlackwell chips\nin Arizona and it plans to manufacture its AI supercomputers — presumably the recently announced\nDGX Spark and DGX Station\n— in Texas.\nNVIDIA says TSMC is already making Blackwell chips in Phoenix, Arizona and the company is partnering with Amkor and SPIL for testing and packaging. In Texas, the company's supercomputers will be made by Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. \"Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months,\" NVIDIA says.\nIt's not entirely clear which version of NVIDIA's Blackwell chips TSMC will actually be building, but the chip maker plans to be equipped to handle a wide variety of manufacturing for US tech companies, including Apple and Qualcomm.

When it launched, OpenAI described\nGPT-4.5\nas its best and most capable model so far, in part because it was a more natural conversationalist and could capably mimic some notion of emotional intelligence. Despite what its name suggests, GPT-4.1 is supposed to be better and more efficient.\nOpenAI says GPT-4.1 is available exclusively to developer's using OpenAI's API, and comes in three sizes, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. That means that if you won't find it as in option in the public-facing ChatGPT interface, but you could someday interact with an agent that leverages the model's improvements. GPT-4.1 is supposed to be better at coding and \"long context understanding,\" according to OpenAI, with support for \"up to one million tokens of context\" and knowledge of the world up to June 2024.\nImportant to the decision to phase out the GPT-4.5 Preview, GPT-4.1 is also cheaper to run. OpenAI says the model is \"26 percent cheaper than GPT-4o for median queries.\" The company imagines developers using GPT-4.1 to build agents that can work in software engineering environments, one of the more popular uses for generative AI. Even though GPT-4.5 will be eventually removed from OpenAI's API, the model preview will still be available in ChatGPT if you wan't to play with it.\nOpenAI says the GPT-4.1 family is available to use today via the company's API. GPT-4.5 will be fully-phased out in three months on July 14, 2025.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-phasing-out-gpt-45-for-developers-185554841.html?src=rss",

It throws a filter over the game screen that simulates various types of color blindness. This allows testers to flag accessibility issues in real time.

It simulates how a person with color blindness will experience a game, allowing devs to take action. It doesn’t fix anything on its own. However, knowing is half the battle as they say. This move by Ubisoft should allow other devs to address these concerns before shipping a game out the door.\nUbisoft isn’t the only company that has been widening the availability of accessibility tools.

Starting this week, the tech giant will begin notifying Europeans through email and its family of apps of the fact, with the message set to include an explanation of the kind of data it plans to use as part of the training. Additionally, the notification will link out to a form users can complete to opt out of the process. \"We have made this objection form easy to find, read, and use, and we’ll honor all objection forms we have already received, as well as newly submitted ones,\" says Meta.\nThe company notes it will only use data it collects from public posts and Meta AI interactions for training purposes. It won't use private messages in its training sets, nor any interactions, public or otherwise, made by users under the age of 18. As for why the company wants to start using EU data now, it claims the information will allow it to fine tune its future models to better serve Europeans.\n\"We believe we have a responsibility to build AI that’s not just available to Europeans, but is actually built for them. That’s why it’s so important for our generative AI models to be trained on a variety of data so they can understand the incredible and diverse nuances and complexities that make up European communities,\" Meta states.\n\"That means everything from dialects and colloquialisms, to hyper-local knowledge and the distinct ways different countries use humor and sarcasm on our products. This is particularly important as AI models become more advanced with multi-modal functionality, which spans text, voice, video, and imagery.\"\nMeta notes other AI companies, including Google and OpenAI, have similarly used data from European users to fine tune their own systems. Today's announcement follows the initial release of Meta's new\nLlama 4\nmodels. After some early hype, the company was\naccused of gaming LMArena\n, a website where humans compare the outputs of different AI models to rank them. Researchers noticed Meta had provided an experimental version of Llama 4 to the site \"optimized for conversationality.”\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-will-start-using-data-from-eu-users-to-train-its-ai-models-175307338.html?src=rss",

In response to new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump shortly after the last\nNintendo Direct presentation\n, the company delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. Canadians will also have to wait as Nintendo has also delayed pre-orders in that country as well, according to a report from\nMobileSyrup\nand confirmed by\nWalmart of Canada via a post on X\n.\nAccording a statement Nintendo provided to Engadget: \"Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.\"\nPresident Trump recently announced a\n90-day pause on steep “reciprocal” tariffs\naffecting 75 countries, but also announced that the tariff imposed on China will go up to 125 percent (we now know it's up to\n145 percent\nfor that country).\nIt’s still unclear what this could mean for Switch 2 pre-orders and pricing, but we do know this: Nintendo started moving some of its\nSwitch console manufacturing to Vietnam\nin 2019. The reciprocal tariff for Vietnam was set to be 46 percent, but with this latest announcement, that appears to be on hold for now in favor of a 10 percent reciprocal tariff that’s now in effect for the 90-day pause period.\nThe latest speculation is that Nintendo will ramp up production of Switch 2 units in Vietnam so it can ship them to the U.S. on schedule, and possibly even\nselling them at a loss\nin the short term.\nNintendo had previously\nannounced\nthe April 9 pre-order date for North America, along with the June 5 date for wider availability. The starting price was to be $450, but that could change now in response to the proposed tariffs. Participating retailers will also be selling the Switch 2 when it eventually makes its way to the U.S. We expect those to include\nAmazon\n,\nBest Buy\n,\nGameStop\n,\nWalmart\nand others.\nThere's some fine-print attached to pre-ordering directly from Nintendo. According to the\npre-order page\non Nintendo's site, you must be 18 years or older, sign in with your Nintendo account and register your interest in pre-ordering. Then, you'll be sent an invitation email when it's time to play your pre-order, and the invitation will be valid for 72 hours. And then there's this bit of info: \"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025.\"\nThat seems to mean those who have paid for Switch Online in the recent past and those who have spent a good amount of time playing Switch games as of late will get first pick at buying a Switch 2. There's no telling if these same restrictions will apply if you want to pre-order from third-party retailers.\nWe knew from the teaser trailer for the\nSwitch 2\nthat Nintendo's new hardware would be bigger and would have a new approach to the detachable Joy-Cons. The new Joy-Con 2 have a new C button,\nmouse controls\nand a built in gyroscope for tilt control. The console has a built-in mic to support a new feature called Game Chat that will let you communicate with friends in-game. The device is indeed a bit larger, with a 7.9-inch LCD screen that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR and a 1080p resolution.\nWhen docked, you'll be able to play at up to 4K on your TV, and Nintendo says it improved the consoles internal speakers as well. The new dock also has a built-in fan to keep the console cool and help maintain performance during long play sessions. The Switch 2 has dual USB-C ports for charging, and the base storage amount has increased to 256GB. The Switch 2's storage can be expanded like the previous model, but it will only work with newer\nmicroSD\nExpress cards.\nThe Switch 2 has a number of\naccessories\nthat you'll be able to purchase separately as well, including the\nnew Switch 2 camera\nfor $50, a new Switch 2 Pro controller for $80, an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers for $90, a Joy-Con 2 charging grip for $35 and more.

We got lighter and sleeker flagship phones in the process, but one has to wonder whether XCover owners are the ones actually living the good life.\nThe Galaxy XCover 7 Pro will be available to order on May 8, 2025. The Galaxy Tab Active 5 Pro is schedule to be released in \"early June,\" according to Samsung.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsungs-latest-rugged-devices-are-keeping-old-school-mobile-traditions-alive-120056640.html?src=rss",

            "title": "The best ergonomic keyboards for 2025",
            "summary": "I probably look at my computer screen more than I look at my family members. And copious hours sitting at a desk have not done favors for my already wonky neck and shoulders. If you also feel some discomfort from typing and mousing the day away, you might want to invest in an ergonomic keyboard. The first time I tried a fully split, thumb cluster board, I knew I had found the answer to my particular problem. But it was tricky to figure out how to type on it. Other unibody boards with angled keys, such as Alice style keyboards, might make things more comfortable for you without requiring much relearning.\nI tried out more than 15 models of ergonomic boards and found a few that stood out. While there’s no single “best” option for everyone (since bodies are inherently different), this guide explores the options so you can find the best ergonomic keyboard for you.\nTable of contents\nBest ergonomic keyboards for 2025\nWhat to look for in an ergonomic keyboard\nHow we tested ergonomic keyboards\nOther ergonomic keyboards we tested\nBest ergonomic keyboards for 2025\nWhat to look for in an ergonomic keyboard\nAlice vs split\nMost ergonomic keyboard layouts fall into two categories: unibody (or Alice) and split. The former is a single board with the two halves of the keys rotated about 30 degrees apart at the bottom. The separation forms an A-shaped space between the keys — which has nothing to do with why it’s called an Alice layout, it’s just a happy coincidence. This subtle tweak pushes your elbows away from your ribs while keeping a straight line from your forearm to your middle knuckle. Using one, I pretty instantly felt more open along the front side of my body. This layout more closely resembles a traditional keyboard, so it should be easier for most folks to get used to than a fully split option.\nSpeaking of, split boards break the keys into two separate parts you can position individually. You can put them shoulder distance apart, bring them closer together or angle them as much as feels comfortable. You can also put your mouse between the halves, which may feel like an easier trip for your cursor hand and could potentially help with conditions like repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Personally, I like being able to put my current snack between the two parts. I've also found that pairing a split keyboard with\na good ergonomic mouse\nhas helped me even more, particularly a vertical mice.\nTenkeyless\nYou can find ergonomic keyboards with and without number pads. Not having those number keys on the right side lets you keep your mouse closer in, minimizing overall reach. But if you work with numbers a lot, you’ll likely want that pad included. Some programmable boards allow for the use of layers, which temporarily repurpose keys and can provide you with a ten-key option through clever remapping of letter keys.\nTenting and negative tilt\nTenting raises the middle of the keyboard up, so your hands move closer to a “handshake” position. Alice keyboards usually angle up towards the middle and always to a fixed degree, since the two sides are connected. Split boards often let you adjust the degree of tenting, going from flat to subtle to extreme lift.\nYou may have encountered keyboards with an optional lift at the back of the board, raising the top keys higher than the space bar. Every set of hands is different, but for most people, pulling the backs of the hands towards the forearms increases strain. Negative tilt has the opposite effect by sloping in the other direction, lowering the top number keys while raising the edge with the spacebar. Many Alice and some split keyboards offer an optional negative tilt. I found it was more comfortable to enable that feature when I’m standing, and I preferred to have the keys flat when sat at my desk.\nStaggered vs columnar\nThis decision seems to be one of the more hotly-contested among ergo enthusiasts. A conventional keyboard has staggered keys, with each row slightly offset to the rows above and below it — so the A key is about halfway between the Q and W above it. This is a holdover from vintage mechanical typewriters, in which each press activated a hammer that smashed ink onto paper in the shape of a letter. To fit the hammers as close together as possible, while still allowing for finger pads, the keys were staggered.\nColumnar or ortholinear keyboards stack the keys in orderly columns, often with rows that are not linear. Proponents claim this makes the keys easier to reach. Whether that’s true will be up to your fingers to decide, but I can say for certain that if you learned to type on a staggered keyboard, switching to a columnar layout is tough. It will take days, possibly weeks before you instinctively hit the C key. The N, M and B keys don’t fare much better.\nProgrammable keys\nWith a few exceptions, most ergonomic keyboards will work with PCs or Macs as a standard typing input, but the use of function and hot keys may require some remapping. It can be as easy as an onboard switch to toggle between Mac and PC layouts, or as involved as downloading software to change up the keys. Some boards even include (or let you buy) extra keycaps to change, say, the Mac’s Command and Option keys to PC’s Start and Alt buttons. Those are what's called hot-swappable keys, meaning you just pull the old key off (usually with a provided key puller) and stick the new one on, no soldering required.\nFor some boards, remapping or programming keys using software is a crucial feature. Gaming peripherals have extra keys that you can set to execute a series of keystrokes with the push of a single button, and we\ncover the best gaming keyboards\nin a separate guide. Keyboards that work with layers, in which a single button can perform several functions, typically allow you to change what those are. Some ergo keyboards have non-standard layouts, like thumb clusters with multiple keys near the space bar that you operate with your thumb. You’ll also be able to program those.\nOther considerations\nErgonomic keyboards come in mechanical, membrane, and scissor switch versions. Which works best for you is, again, up to your preference. I won’t get too deep into the particulars here, as we have an entire guide\ndevoted to the best mechanical boards\n, but the short of it is that membrane and scissor switches are less customizable than mechanical and typically cheaper. Typing on them tends to be quieter and softer. Mechanical switches are more customizable, offer a more responsive typing experience and are usually pricier.\nYou’ll also have the option of wired or wireless ergonomic boards. All other things being equal, wired models are less expensive. Competitive gamers who rely on split-second responses may prefer the zero-lag of wired keyboards. Wired models also never run out of battery life and have fewer connectivity issues. But wireless keyboards keep your desk less cluttered.\nSome ergonomic keyboards come with permanent or removable wrist or palm rests, which can be cushioned or hard. This is another area where opinions diverge: proponents claim they help you maintain a neutral hand position, while detractors say they put pressure on the tendons in your wrist and can exacerbate conditions like carpal tunnel. Ideally, your palms should be resting, not your wrists, and you might find you like having that support or you may find the pressure uncomfortable.\nPhoto by Amy Skorheim / Engadget\nHow we tested ergonomic keyboards\nAll our guides begin with extensive research to figure out what’s out there and what’s worth testing. We consider brands with good reputations that we’ve heard good things about from colleagues and look at keyboard reviews in forums and other trusted publications. For this guide, I looked for keyboards with ergonomic features like tenting, split keys, palm support and so on. I also zeroed in on boards that didn’t require a deep amount of familiarity with the vast and exhaustive world of custom keyboards.\nOnce I settled on ten boards, I acquired them and used each one for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. I tried out the remapping and macros software and considered the comfort, design, price and durability of each model before arriving at picks I think will work best for the most people out there. For subsequent updates to this guide, I have continued to acquire and test out new keyboards as they come on the market, adding and replacing the top picks as warranted. If and when Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, like the Sculpt, come back on the market, as a\ncollaboration with Incase has promised\n, I'll try those models, too.\nOther ergonomic keyboards we tested\nNaya Create\nI didn’t get to fully test the\nNaya Create\nkeyboard, but I was able to try one out for a few minutes during\nCES this year\n. It’s one of the more customizable keyboards you’ll find. Not only is it a fully split, mechanical board with programmable keys, the thumb clusters sit just below two modular platforms that each accept a touchpad, rollerball, dial or a 3D joystick. These are meant to replace your mouse and other input devices, eliminating travel for your cursor hand. Each half of the keyboard body bends in two places to allow for precise tenting and, from my short time with the Naya, the hinges and the entire board felt solidly built. The Naya Create starts at $500 before you add on any of the mouse modules, but that’s not stopping people from ordering. According to Naya’s website, the first three batches of pre-orders sold out and the fourth batch will ship in July 2025.\nGoldtouch Elite Adjustable\nI remember wondering if something like the\nGoldtouch Elite Adjustable\nexisted when I first started testing ergonomic keyboards. It didn’t at the time, as far as I could tell, but now a connected yet adjustable split board is indeed a product you can buy. It’s a solidly-built board and the ball joint connecting the two halves feels like it will put up with a lot of use. A squeeze of the lever at the top of the keys lets you set the board just how you like, adjusting both the vertical tenting and the angle between the two halves. There’s no programming to speak of, just the ability to swap a few function keys like print screen and home.\nUnfortunately, the tenting doesn’t work for me. Because of the extra keys at the outer edges, raising the middle edges upwards lifts the center keys considerably, which brings my wrists and forearms off the desk instead of letting them rest. Holding them like that created extra neck and shoulder strain on my part, which is sort of the opposite of the goal. But if you’re not into tenting anyway and want a flat, Alice-split board with an adjustable splay, this works quite well.\nKinesis Form Split Touchpad Keyboard\nThe idea behind the\nKinesis Form Split Touchpad Keyboard\nis pretty ergonomic: put the trackpad between the two halves and minimize travel for your mouse hand. The distance between the two puts your elbows at a comfortable distance and keeps your wrist nearly in-line with your forearms. The build is excellent, with low profile mechanical switches that feel smooth and just the right amount of clacky. The trackpad is responsive, but gestures only work with Windows computers. Even dragging and dropping doesn’t work on a Mac here, so I don’t see Apple users getting much use out of the board. I also found myself wishing for the slightest rotation of the keys — though they’re a good distance apart, a slight angle would keep my wrists fully unbent. There’s no tenting or negative tilt either, both of which could help a bit more, ergonomically speaking.\nLogitech Wavekeys\nWhile it's a perfectly fine and affordable Bluetooth keyboard, the\nLogitech Wavekeys\nhas minimal ergonomics. The keys rise up slightly in the middle and there's a comfortable wrist rest attached, but the layout is the same as any other keyboard, with no splitting of the keys to open up your arms or keep your wrists straight.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ergonomic-keyboard-130047982.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "Whether you're listening to playlists on your daily commute or zoning out with a podcast at home, wireless headphones can make your audio experience much more comfortable. With no cords to untangle or get caught on your bag, they’re a great pick for anyone who wants convenience without compromising on sound quality. If comfort and immersive audio are high on your priority list, over-ear wireless headphones are often the way to go — they wrap around your ears to help block out the world and deliver rich detailed sound that earbuds can sometimes miss.\nThere’s a wide range of over-ear wireless headphones to choose from, whether you want active noise cancellation, long battery life or a comfy fit for marathon listening sessions. Of course, if you're after something a little more compact or tailored to a specific use case, we also have you covered with our buying guides for the\nbest earbuds\n, the\nbest gaming headsets\nand the\nbest budget earbuds\n. But if wireless headphones with top-tier sound and a comfortable, over-ear design are what you're after, read on — we’ve tested the top options to help you find the right pair.\nTable of contents\nBest wireless headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\nHow we test over-ear headphones\nOther wireless headphones we tested\nWireless headphones FAQs\nBest wireless headphones for 2025\nHow to choose the best wireless headphones for you\nWhen it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer’s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you’ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you’ll want to not only make sure it’s there, but also make sure it’s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.\nThe next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you’re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don’t take basic things like automatic pausing and\nBluetooth\nmultipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company’s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you’re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don’t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.\nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer’s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like\nSpatial Audio\n,\nDolby Atmos\n, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.\nHow we test over-ear headphones\nThe primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and\npodcasts\n, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.\nTo judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we’ll record audio samples with the headphones’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.\nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.\nOther wireless headphones we tested\nAirPods Max\nApple’s AirPods Max\nare premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.\nDyson On-Trac\nThe\nOn-Trac headphones\nhave an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.\nSonos Ace\nThe\nSonos Ace\nis an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.\nSony ULT Wear\nIf most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the\nULT Wear\nis an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.\nSony WH-CH720N\nWhile the\nWH-CH720N\nare a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony’s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they’re made with a lot of plastic.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe\nStudio Pro\nlacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra headphones\nBose’s latest flagship model\nhas a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There’s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.\nMaster & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)\nThe\nMH40\nare a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8\nThe company’s trademark pristine sound is on display\nhere\n, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.\nWireless headphones FAQs\nHow can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?\nI typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.\nHow do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?\n“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?\nWhich brand has the best wireless headphones?\nSony consistently tops our list with\nits 1000X line\n. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies,\nlike Bose\n, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.\nDo expensive wireless headphones sound better?\nExorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality.\nBowers & Wilkins’\nheadphones\nare on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However,\nAudio-Technica’s M50xBT2\nis much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html?src=rss",

            "title": "The Last of Us season two premiere: 'Future Days' highlights the fracture between Ellie and Joel",
            "summary": "Spoilers follow for\nThe Last of Us\nseason two, episode one\nThe heart of all things\nThe Last of Us\n, whether it’s the games or the first season of the HBO adaptation, is the relationship between Joel and Ellie. It was brought to life in remarkable fashion by Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey\nin season one\n; the pair’s chemistry was the show’s\nundeniable high point\n. So it’s a bit of a shock that they only share a few minutes of screen time together in the season two premiere “Future Days” — and that their time together is\nstrained\nto say the very least.\nThat all comes near the end of the episode, though. Backing up a bit, the show resumes exactly where we left off, with Ellie saying “okay” to Joel’s lies about what happened in the season one finale. That episode saw him decimate the Fireflies to save the immune Ellie. The Fireflies were hoping to make a cure for the cordyceps infection that devastated the world, but it would have killed her in the process. “Okay” meant that she was accepting his story, even if she didn’t quite believe it.\nFast forward five years\n, and things are tense — so tense that our hardened Joel is in therapy.\nWe get to eavesdrop on a session with Joel’s therapist Gail, played by the always-wonderful Catherine O’Hara. I’ve been looking forward to seeing how she’d be used since Gail was revealed in an early trailer, and both her and Joel are having a\nday\nwhen they get together. Joel’s relationship with Ellie is apparently what drove him to meet with Gail, and he’s going on about the distance in their relationship — she barely talks to him, sulks and acts distant, and Gail isn’t exactly impressed. She notes that Ellie is acting like every other 19-year-old acts towards their father, and also says it's clear there’s a lot more going on between them.\nPedro Pascal and Catherine O'Hara in HBO's The Last of Us season two\nPhotograph by Liane Hentscher/HBO\nGail then opens up to Joel in an effort to get him to be honest (and because she’s a few drinks in) and drops a bit of a bomb in the process: Joel shot her husband Eugene (a character from\nThe Last of Us Part II\nwho we never met in the game). She says she understood that he had to do it — an implication but not confirmation that Eugene had been infected — but can’t forgive him for the way she found out and can’t help but hate him for what he did. Not the kind of thing you usually hear from your therapist, but that’s\nThe Last of Us\nfor you. She then gets Joel to tearfully admit he did\nsomething\nto Ellie, but when she asks if he hurt her, he responds by saying he saved her and then gets the hell out of her house. Season one showed Joel as a more vulnerable person than his game counterpart, a change that benefitted him given the expanded drama and depth of the show, and I’m glad season two is emphasizing that in a way that’s pretty unconventional for the post-apocalypse world.\nWe also get a hint at the discord between Joel and Ellie via Dina, a new character introduced as Ellie’s best friend through a conversation she has with Joel. The two of them are getting along just fine; Joel even calls her “kiddo,” showing a similar dad-like affection for Dina that he usually does with Ellie. After a little chat she asks him point blank why Ellie’s angry with him, and he responds with more vagaries about the two of them figuring out what it’s like being a father and daughter at her age while asking Dina to keep the therapy sessions he’s having a secret — his therapy-speak when discussing how he’s dealing with everything was just too on the nose for her to miss.\nIsabela Merced and Bella Ramsey in The Last of Us season two\nPhotograph by Liane Hentscher/HBO\nBut the most pivotal scene in this exposition-heavy episode is the New Year’s Eve party where Dina and Ellie share a dance, share a kiss and get shouted at by the drunk town bigot. Just as Ellie is about to treat him like a clicker, Joel intercedes, shoves Seth to the ground and asks if she’s okay — which gets him a disgusted look and verbal smackdown from Ellie, after which he slinks away in decidedly un-Joel fashion.\nThings are decidedly unwell between the pair, and while it’s an intriguing note to start the story on, it’s also hard not to be disappointed about the lack of time together for Pascal and Ramsey. Having them at odds is a totally reasonable story beat — even if she was a normal 19-year-old, they’d be having their share of challenges. But the loss of their connection and the lack of interactions between the two put a subdued mood over everything, something that episode writer / director and showrunner Craig Mazin certainly intended and will exploit throughout the season.\nPhotograph by Liane Hentscher/HBO\nMazin also paid tribute to the game in some lovely ways in this episode, particularly with the town party scene. Right from the start of season one, I expected to see more scenes from the game done nearly note-for-note in the show, and my expectations have been largely defied throughout, right from the start of the series’ first episode. It’s been clear that the goal of the show is not to reproduce all of the game’s iconic scenes but expand on it while still picking the right moments to deploy some tributes to the source material. The party scene is a perfect example, starting off with a shot of Ellie’s back as she looks over the merriment in front of her; what follows is nearly identical to the pivotal game scene in dialog, set design and framing. What\nis\ndifferent, though, is the timing — we’re getting this right off the bat rather than much later in the story as you’d find in the game.\nSimilarly, the episode’s\nother\nmost significant scene takes place right at the beginning. After that quick flashback, we’re immediately introduced to Abby, one of the second game’s playable characters. We learn that she and her friends are survivors of Joel’s Firefly massacre at the hospital in Utah, and that Abby in particular is keen on revenge. Mazin and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann have already discussed how they wanted to introduce Abby and get into her motivations quicker in the show than in the game, largely because players build a relationship with her through gameplay. In this case, though, we already know that Abby is after Joel, and the episode ends with her crew reaching Jackson. While “Future Days” focused more on scene-setting than action (with the exception of some pretty tense scenes of Ellie and Dina against some Infected), things are clearly going to ratchet up next week — and not just with Abby, as the show also teased a major Infected threat as well. Let’s get those flamethrowers ready for next Sunday.\nInfected score: 6/10\nOne of the main complaints from fans of the video games during season one was a relative lack of Infected. The showrunners say they’ve changed things up in season two — let’s see if they’re sticking to their word.\nEpisode one was mostly an exposition episode without a ton of action, but we did see Ellie and Dina stealthily take down a pair of Clickers. But the most exciting bit was seeing a Stalker in action for the first time in the show. It had Ellie completely fooled, even giving her another bite that she had to hide from Dina. Here’s hoping we see more of these creepers as the season goes on. And, of course, the threat of tendrils lurking in the pipe in the middle of Jackson promises bigger problems soon, but we’re not there yet. I’m giving this episode a 6 of 10 — there wasn’t all that much action, but the stalker reveal was intense enough to up this episode’s rating.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-last-of-us-season-two-premiere-future-days-highlights-the-fracture-between-ellie-and-joel-020029565.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "US Customs and Border Protection on Friday night published\na list of products\nexcluded from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, including smartphones, computers and memory chips, along with other electronic devices and components. But in an interview with\nABC News’ Jonathan Karl\non Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the move doesn't mean these products will be exempt from tariffs altogether — they're just getting their own category. “Those products are going to be part of the semiconductor sectoral tariffs, which are coming,” Lutnick said.\nIt all comes shortly after Trump imposed a 125 percent tariff on goods from China, which the administration confirmed to\nCNBC\nand other outlets is in addition to the 20 percent tariff put in place earlier this year, bringing it to a total of 145 percent. Trump had previously announced higher reciprocal tariffs for other countries, too, but walked this back with\na 90-day “pause” earlier this week\n. The pause does not apply to China, though, and there’s still a 10 percent tariff on imports from almost all countries. Electronics imports in particular are expected to be hit hard by the new rules, and we’ve already seen\ncompanies like Nintendo\nand\nRazer changing up their plans\naround upcoming\nproduct launches in the US\n.\nThe newly published exclusions would exempt many devices and parts from both the 10 percent global tariff and the steeper tariff on China, according to the notice published on Friday. Lutnick told ABC News’ Jonathan Karl that, in doing this, the president was “just making sure everyone understood that all of these products are outside the reciprocal tariffs and they are going to have their own separate way of being considered.” The move is meant to “make sure that those products get reshored,” Lutnick said, or in other words, made in America. “So what he’s doing is, he’s saying they’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick said.\nUpdate, April 13 2025, 1:43PM ET:\nThis story has been updated to include new information about a separate semiconductor tariff from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that was shared in an ABC News interview on Sunday.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/smartphones-computers-and-other-electronics-are-exempt-from-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-for-now-153139830.html?src=rss",

            "title": "Doctor Who ‘The Robot Revolution’ review: Meet Belinda Chandra",
            "summary": "Spoilers for “The Robot Revolution.”\nThe start of any season of\nDoctor Who\nis important, doubly so when there’s a new co-star to introduce. “The Robot Revolution” has to get us to fall in love with Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu), ensnare new fans and keep existing ones hooked. Especially since it’s the second of two series that Disney paid for, meaning it’s got to do well enough to keep the money flowing.\nWe open “17 years ago” with Belinda Chandra staring at the stars next to her boyfriend, Alan Budd (Jonny Green). It’s an awkward teenage date, with Alan clearly trying to win the heart of his beau by buying her one of those star adoption certificates. In 2025, Belinda is now a nurse at a busy London hospital where, in the background, the Doctor is searching for her.\nBelinda goes home to bed, and we see that she’s got the star ownership certificate framed on her wall. But she’s rudely awoken by a squad of retro-futuristic ‘50s robots in a\nTintin rocket\nwho have come to abduct both her\nand\nthe certificate. The Doctor reaches her home just in time to see the rocket take off, and cue the opening credits.\nThe certificate wasn’t a gag present, and she is actually queen of the planet BelindaChandra, populated by BelindaChandrians (I’m calling them humans from now on). The Doctor gives chase in the TARDIS but both the rocket and TARDIS get caught in a vaguely-defined time fissure. When Belinda arrives, she’s greeted by the human Sasha55, who tells her the robots are in charge, having overthrown and subjugated the people in a bloody uprising a decade prior.\n“Oh, this is a bit like\nJupiter Ascending\n,” I wrote in my notes.\nBelinda is taken to a throne room where she’s told that she must merge with the planet’s evil ruling supercomputer, the AI Generator. AI Generator, all skull shapes and Tesla coils, intends to\nbond\nwith\nBelinda\n. She is shown an animated demonstration of her fate, as she is wrapped in machine parts and made into an unthinking cyborg.\n“Oh, that's like the scary bit from\nSuperman III\n,” I wrote in my notes.\nWho’s been lurking in the background of the scene all along? The Doctor, who has adopted the title of Planetary Historian. (Thanks to the time fissure, he arrived here six months ahead of the rocket, the Robots seized the TARDIS and he’s been working with the rebellion. He’s even got a new companion, Sasha55, who he’s promised to take to the stars when this is all over.) He tells Belinda the robots can’t, for some reason, hear every ninth word spoken, and gives her a coded message telling her he, and the rebellion, are here to rescue her. In the ensuing fight, Sasha55 is vaporized, much to the Doctor’s admittedly brief horror and grief.\nThe surviving rebels, along with a little Roomba bot assigned to clean Queen Belinda’s pathway…\n“Oh, like the floor-cleaning robot M-O from\nWall-E,\n” I wrote in my notes.\n… escape to a teleporter, after which the Doctor disables the Roomba to ensure the robots can’t track them down, then kisses the ‘bot by way of apology. Then comes time for the episode to stop while we see the Doctor and Belinda interact properly for the first time. The Doctor was told about Belinda’s plight by someone from their future, and he can’t say more lest he muddle the timelines.\nAlistair Heap / BBC Studios / Disney / Bad Wolf\nThe time fracture both vessels passed through has caused plenty of time-bending issues, like the fact the robots have their own copy of Belinda’s star certificate. But it’s not a copy, it’s the same object from another point in time, and nobody knows how or why they have it. Belinda, like Ruby Sunday before her, is trope-aware enough to know that two of the same object from different points in time cannot occupy the same space, lest it cause an explosion.\n“Oh, like in\nTimecop!\n,” I wrote in my notes.\nThere are wounded at the base, and Belinda instantly kicks into nurse mode, grabbing IVs and treating patients. She’s quick to take charge and has no patience for nonsense, quick to defend herself from any hint of condescension when the Doctor suggests something “\ntimey-wimey\n” is going on. She refuses to allow anyone to fight her battles for her and is determined to grab the narrative and shape it her way, no matter the cost. So, she sneaks off, reactivates the Roomba and offers herself to the robots in exchange for them sparing the lives of the rebels.\nBelinda and the Doctor are taken to meet the AI Generator which turns out to be… the AL Generator. When Belinda was kidnapped by the robots, she mentioned her ex Alan had bought the certificate, and so they went to kidnap him as well. But the time fracture meant Alan arrived a decade earlier, fused with the machine (becoming a creepy cyborg) and started the robot uprising.\nEven so, Belinda’s happy to sacrifice herself to him until she spots Alan holding his copy of the star certificate. She opts to\nTimecop\nthe two pieces of paper together, causing a big timey-wimey explosion that only the Doctor can pull her out of. Belinda is safe, but the Doctor mentions that he’s now intertwined with Belinda’s timestream. Alan, meanwhile, has been regressed to a sperm on the floor that the Roomba bot quickly mops away.\nReunited with the TARDIS, the Doctor scans Belinda and reveals he’s already met her descendant — Mundy Flynn (also Varada Sethu) from last season’s “\nBoom\n.” Belinda may be curious as to how someone that far removed from her may be identical, but she’s not embracing the mystery. She’s angry with the Doctor for scanning her without consent and that he’s treating her like a puzzle to be solved.\nHaving seen Sasha55 die, she knows trekking around with the Doctor is dangerous, and wants to get back to May 24, 2025. But the TARDIS won’t land on present-day Earth, and even the\nCloister Bell\nbegins ringing a warning. They open the TARDIS doors to see empty space before the Doctor decides to take her back home “the long way round.”\nOnce the ship disappears, a series of objects start to float in front of the camera: A smashed up\nblack cab\n, the twisted wreckage of the Eiffel Tower, Belinda’s star adoption certificate and a calendar with all the days in May but the 25th ticked off. Uh-oh.\nIt's a lot to get through in such a short episode\nAlistair Heap / BBC Studios / Bad Wolf\nLike a lot of Disney-era Who, “The Robot Revolution” feels overstuffed to the point of bursting. On one hand, nothing overstays its welcome. On the other, it feels like the show is burning through a movie’s worth of plot on fast-forward. It’s hard to get a tangible sense of the stakes given how rushed everything is, and there’s a lot of telling, rather than showing. We’re told the planet is under the brutal thumb of an evil overlord but it plays out as little red ships firing at buildings in the digital matte paintings. We’re told Alan is a creep but we never really get any sense of that until\nafter\nhe’s revealed as the villain. We’re told the Doctor is operating on instructions from a figure from his own future, but it’d be nice if some of this was depicted.\nDavies was pivotal in reviving\nDoctor Who\nand building the cultural juggernaut it became under his leadership. His role in the show’s history is secure but, even so, his Disney-era series seem to be in thrall to the work of his own successor, Steven Moffat. “The Robot Revolution” features a macguffin found inside a mundane trinket, a split narrative and time-bending shenanigans. It’s not that Moffat owns these ideas but you can almost feel Davies trying to bend his less formal, more character-driven style into something else. A cynic might suggest Davies is reacting to the slight of not having a single credited episode in\nDoctor Who Magazine’s\nmost recent poll of the series’ greatest, while Moffat has five.\nIn fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if the slightly frantic, gappy nature of this script is a deliberate ploy to lay the framework for the rest of the season. But, even so, you can feel a degree of straining for a storytelling model that doesn’t quite work.\nIf the script is the weakest part of the episode, then the production design has to take the crown for strongest. The retro-futuristic robots call to mind a bright red Ford Thunderbird or Chevy Bel Air while the cleaning robot is clearly styled on a VW Beetle. It’s a rather humanistic design I wish the robovac makers of today would emulate.\nBehind the scenes\nJames Pardon / BBC Studios / Disney / Bad Wolf\nDoctor Who\nis a regular source of gossip, especially given the permanently tenuous nature of the star role. It’s easy to say the lead is about to quit and for that to sound true, given they leave after three or four years in the role anyway. There are a number of recent reports suggesting Ncuti Gatwa has already quit the show, or is about to. Many of them also suggest the BBC and Disney are refusing to greenlight new episodes until they see how successful this season is. In addition, the\nBBC says funding cuts and inflation has seen its budget fall by £1 billion (around $1.3 billion) in real terms since 2010\n. It doesn't help that, when asked directly about the future of the series in an interview with (the BBC's youth-orientated news show)\nNewsround\n, Russell T. Davies opted to equivocate in a way that suggests the show is about to back on ice.\nI mention this because of the sequence where Belinda defeats Alan with the certificate, and the Doctor pulls her out. He says she needed a Time Lord to absorb the enormous amount of energy kicked out when she touched the paper together. The Doctor then clutched at his back as if he was in a lot of pain, but shrugged it off and was fine for the rest of the episode. Fans with long memories, however, know that absorbing a lot of energy from the time vortex is what killed Christopher Eccleston’s Doctor back in 2005. Well, that and Eccleston’s decision to leave.\nMrs. Flood Corner\nLara Cornell / BBC Studios / Disney / Bad Wolf\nIt seems Mrs. Flood enjoys moving in next door to whoever is winding up as this year’s companion. While being abducted, she calls to her neighbor to call the police and tell her parents she loves them. As the rocket lifts off, she tells the audience that we haven’t seen her, and goes back indoors to avoid encountering the Doctor, who sprints out in pursuit.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/doctor-who-the-robot-revolution-review-meet-belinda-chandra-190054697.html?src=rss",

            "summary": "Netflix\nhas started testing a new search feature powered by OpenAI that can help customers find movies and shows to watch, according to\nBloomberg\n. The streaming service has reportedly given select users in Australia and New Zealand the option to use the tool. It will allow users to search for terms other than a specific show's title, an actor's name or the genre they want to watch.\nBloomberg\nsays it will give them a way to search for content using more specific terms, like their mood. Presumably, that means the service can surface dramatic shows for a search query that says \"sad,\" and seeing as it's powered by generative AI, users will most likely be able to use natural language in their search terms.\nAs the news organization notes, Netflix already uses artificial intelligence for some of its existing features, such as learning user's preferences based on their viewing history to recommend titles they're more likely to watch. And it's looking for more ways to use the technology. At the moment, OpenAI-powered searches are only being tested in the two countries, but Netflix reportedly has plans to expand its testing to more markets, including the United States. The company has history of rolling out features to Android users first\nbefore making them available\non iOS.

UK bureau chief Mat Smith recently put the iPhone 16 Pro\nthrough its paces again\n, noting that Apple Intelligence remains a disappointment. Deputy news editor Nathan Ingraham got early access to\nThe Last of Us\nahead of the season two premiere this weekend.\nHe explains\nthat the show navigates a rough patch in the source material with relative ease, and his review won't spoil the new episodes.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-the-pixel-9a-smart-glasses-and-amds-latest-cpu-141825552.html?src=rss",

            "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Affiliate Marketing",

What is affiliate marketing?\nAffiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies.

What is an affiliate program?\nAn affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers.

Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.\n3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?\nAffiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.  Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.\n4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?\nDropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\n5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?\nPerformance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\n6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?\nSmartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.\n7. Where do I find qualified publishers?\nThe best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.\n8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?\nAn affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\n9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?\nPublishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.\n10. What is a super affiliate?\nA super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.  Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.\n11. How do we track publisher sales activity?\nPublishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.\n12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?\nBecause the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.\n13.

Do you have to pay to sign up for an affiliate program?\nTo build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.\n17. What is a commission rate?\nCommission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.\nWho manages your affiliate program?\nSome merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.\n18. What is a cookie?\nCookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents.

Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration\n19. How long do cookies last?\nThe merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its “cookie life.” The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you’ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.\nFinal Saying\nMost new affiliates are eager to begin their affiliate marketing business. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information out there that can lead inexperienced affiliates astray. Hopefully, the answer to your question will provide clarity on how affiliate marketing works and the pitfalls you can avoid. Most importantly, keep in mind that success in affiliate marketing takes some time. Don't be discouraged if you're not immediately making sales or earning money. It takes most new affiliates months to make a full-time income.",

            "summary": "If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.\nImagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.\nIt’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.\nBlockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.\nA few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.\nSo, What is Blockchain?\nA blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.\nBlockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.\nBlockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.\nTo understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:\nBlockchain collects information in “blocks”.\nA block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.\nBlocks form chains, which are called “Blockchains.”\nMore information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.\nEach block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.\nLet’s get to know more about the blockchain.\nHow does blockchain work?\nBlockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.\nHere’s how it works:\nSomeone or a computer will transacts\nThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.\nA network of computers can confirm the transaction.\nWhen it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block\nThe blocks are linked together to create a history.\nAnd that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.\nA new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.\nOnce a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.\nHow are Blockchains used?\nEven though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\nBlockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.\nAlthough some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.\nTracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been—so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.\nBlockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.\nWhat is Blockchain Decentralization?\nBlockchain technology is safe, even if it’s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.\nHave you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?\nBlockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.\nInstead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called “Decentralization,” meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.\nBlockchain guarantees your data's authenticity—not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.\nPros and Cons of Blockchain\nBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.\nPros\nAccuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.\nOne of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.\nSafe, private, and easy transactions\nProvides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information\nCons\nData storage has limits.\nThe regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.\nIt has a risk of being used for illicit activities\nFrequently Asked Questions About Blockchain\nI’ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.\nIs Blockchain a cryptocurrency?\nBlockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.\nIs it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?\nYes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.\nWhat is the most prominent blockchain company?\nCoinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.\nWho owns Blockchain?\nBlockchain is a decentralized technology. It’s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.\nWhat is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency\nWhat is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?\nGenerally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.\nFinal Saying\nBlockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

            "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens)",
            "summary": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.\n1) What is an NFT?\nNFT stands for non-fungible  token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.\n2) What is Blockchain?\nA blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.\n3) What makes an NFT valuable?\nThe value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.\n4) How do NFTs work?\nOne of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.\nAs with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.\nNFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.\n5) What’s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?\nAnyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creations\n6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?\nWhen you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.\n7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?\nThe value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.\nIn the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.\n8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?\nNon-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.\n9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?\nMany people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.\n10) How do we buy an NFTs?\nThere are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.\n11) Can i mint NFT for free?\nTo mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.\n12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?\nThe answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.\n12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?\nNon-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don’t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.\nYou can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.\nFinal Saying\nThat’s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening.

            "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About  Email Marketing",
            "summary": "1. Why is email marketing important?\nEmail is the marketing tool that helps you  create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak  to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.\n2. What is benefits of email marketing?\nEmail marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.\nBenefits of email marketing for bussiness:\nBetter brand recognition\nStatistics of what works best\nMore sales\nTargeted audience\nMore traffic to your products/services/newsletter\nBuild credibility\nMost  bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.\n3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?\nAgain, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be  times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your  data to decide.\n4. Which metrics should I be looking at?\nThe two most important metrics for email marketing are  open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.\n5. How do I write a decent subject line?\nThe best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing  the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for  A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and  simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,  then repeated  at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.\n6. Is email marketing still effective?\nEmail marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site  hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans  see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely  see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.\n7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?\nBuying an email list is  waste of time & money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.\nGive them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.\n8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?\nIf the  subject line of the email is irrelevant to  customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus  on sales, offers and discounts.\nSubmit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to  connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.\n9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?\nCold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.\nRegularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are  your emails will soon be diverted to  spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.\n10. Where can I find email template?\nAlmost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.\nHowever, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.\n11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?\nIs it a trend to listen to  and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.\nFinal Saying\nYou can approach email marketing in different ways. We have compiled a list of most frequently asked questions to help you understand how to get started, what constraints you need to keep in mind, and what future development you will need, we don’t have 100% answers to every situation and there’s always a chance you will have something new and different to deal with as you market your own business.",

Sensex, the 30-pack index of the Bombay Stock Exchange opened over 1,500 points higher while Nifty regained the 23,000 level, boosted by a surge in automobile stocks. Experts, however, suggest volatility would continue across global markets.\nRupee, meanwhile, jumped 39 paise to 85.71 against the US dollar as currency markets opened this morning, with forex traders suggesting a weak US currency index has strengthened the rupee despite the foreign capital outflow.\nTrump had imposed a flat 25% tariffs on auto imports earlier this month.

The sharp uptick in Indian equities reflected improved investor sentiment after the temporary easing of global trade tensions.\nAjay Bagga, banking and market expert, explained, \"Indian markets will open with a gap up largely due to the Wednesday US market surge following the Trump reciprocal tariffs postponement for 90 days. However, the Thursday fall in the US markets led to a fall in the Gift Nifty as well. Hence, versus a 700 plus rally on Wednesday, on Friday morning, the Gift Nifty premium to the domestic Nifty future close of Wednesday afternoon is down to 400 points, Si positive open but momentum is reduced.\"\nHe added, \"With Monday again being an Indian market holiday, positions will be reduced this afternoon. So a gap-up open could end with a flattish Indian market. The US dollar index falling to 100 levels ( DXY) is positive for EM flows eventually, but the sentiment is fragile and frayed. So, caution is advised.

US markets reversed course on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1,014 points and the Nasdaq dropping by 4.5 per cent. The continued uncertainty surrounding global trade policy weighed heavily on investor sentiment.\nAmid rising market volatility, gold prices in India surged to an all-time high of Rs91,500 per 10 grams as investors turned to safe-haven assets. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc also saw increased inflows.\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) fell to 100, which could eventually benefit emerging markets, but analysts warned that sentiment remains fragile.\nOn the corporate front, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported earnings below market expectations, leading several brokerages to slash their target prices for the IT giant.\nAdding to the global concerns, a White House official confirmed that China's average tariff rate would rise to 145 per cent, further intensifying trade tensions.\nWith uncertainty looming large, experts are advising investors to proceed with caution despite the short-term rally in equities.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\nShow full article\nTrack\nLatest News\nLive on NDTV.com and get\nnews\nupdates from\nIndia\nand around the\nworld\nFollow us:\nSensex\n,\nTrump Tariffs\n,\nNifty",

Here's What It Means\nRBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced this decision during the first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of FY26\nEdited by:\nNDTV News Desk\nBusiness News\nApr 09, 2025 11:17 am IST\nPublished On\nApr 09, 2025 11:16 am IST\nLast Updated On\nApr 09, 2025 11:17 am IST\nRead Time:\n3 mins\nShare\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nReddit\nEmail\nThis is the second consecutive cut after a similar rate reduction in February.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut the repo rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down from 6.25% to 6% - a move expected to ease borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced the decision during the first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of FY26, held from April 7 to 9. This is the second consecutive cut after a similar rate reduction in February.\nWhat Is The Repo Rate?\nThe\nrepo rate\nis the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks for short-term needs, usually against government securities. It's a key tool used by the central bank to manage inflation and liquidity in the economy.\nWhy Did The RBI Cut The Repo Rate?\nThe RBI reduces the repo rate when it wants to inject more liquidity into the system and boost economic activity - especially when inflation is under control. For FY26, the RBI has projected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation at 4%, comfortably within its target range of 2-6%.\nGlobal uncertainties over trade tensions triggered by US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs have also influenced the decision, as they pose risks to global growth and India's exports.\nHow Will It Affect You?\nLoan EMIs May Get Cheaper - With the repo rate cut, banks and financial institutions can borrow funds from the RBI at a lower cost. This could lower interest rates on home loans, auto loans, and new personal loans. The actual reduction in EMIs, however, depends on how quickly and to what extent individual banks pass on the benefits to consumers.\nImpact On Fixed Deposits - While borrowers may cheer, fixed deposit (FD) investors could see a downside. As lending rates go down, banks may also cut interest rates on deposits to protect their margins. New FD investors might earn lower returns than those who locked in earlier at higher rates. If you are planning to invest in FDs, it might be wise to do so before banks revise rates downward.\nPersonal Loan Borrowers - If you already have a personal loan, especially one with a fixed interest rate, your EMI will likely remain the same. But if you are planning to take a new personal loan, the rate cut could mean lower interest rates and more affordable repayments.\nGovernor Sanjay Malhotra said the Indian economy was on track, projecting GDP growth at 6.5% for FY 2025-26. This is the quarterly breakdown:\nQ1: 6.5%\nQ2: 6.7%\nQ3: 6.6%\nQ4: 6.3%\nHe also said that the agriculture sector looks promising due to healthy reservoir levels and robust crop production. The manufacturing and services sectors are showing signs of revival, and urban consumption is gradually picking up. Investment activity is rising, backed by strong corporate and bank balance sheets and continued government focus on infrastructure.\nShow full article\nTrack\nLatest News\nLive on NDTV.com and get\nnews\nupdates from\nIndia\nand around the\nworld\nFollow us:\nRBI\n,\nRepo Rate\n,\nRBI Governor",

This will reduce borrowing costs for banks and enable them to lend money to individual customers at lower rates, reducing EMIs for loans. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said today that the Monetary Policy Committee had voted unanimously to reduce the repo rate.\nThis is the second time this year that the central bank has cut repo rate. Earlier, it had reduced the key rate to 6.25 per cent in February.\nThe repo rate, also known as the purchase agreement rate, is the interest rate charged by the RBI from commercial banks on the money it lends to them. So when it is reduced, banks often pass on the benefits to the consumers.\nThe RBI Governor said the financial year begins on an anxious note for the global economy and the central bank is keeping an eye on inflation risks emerging from global uncertainties. This comes days after the Donald Trump administration in the US imposed reciprocal tariffs on exports from India.\n\"The dent on global growth due to trade frictions will impede domestic growth. Higher tariffs may have an impact on net exports. India is very proactively engaging with the US administration on trade,\" the RBI Governor said. He said it is difficult to quantify now the impact global developments would have on growth. But he said the central bank was not concerned about being able to manage domestic growth.\nThe prospects for the agriculture sector remain bright and manufacturing activity is showing signs of revival, he said. \"Services sector continues to show resilience. Urban consumption is picking up with uptick in discretionary spending,\" he said, adding that balance sheets of banks and corporates are \"healthy\".\nThe RBI Governor said that the Monetary Policy Committee had noted that inflation is currently below target and the sharp fall in food prices.\nThe GDP growth estimate for this fiscal has been cut by 20 basis points and the real GDP growth is now projected at 6.5 per cent.\nShow full article\nTrack\nLatest News\nLive on NDTV.com and get\nnews\nupdates from\nIndia\nand around the\nworld\nFollow us:\nRBI CUTS REPO RATE\n,\nRBI Cuts Lending Rate\n,\nRBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra",

The episode served as a reminder to some investors that it doesn't take much to spark a sudden rally at moments like this, forcing them to rethink how much they'd gutted their equity positions.\n\"The upside risk is just as scary when markets rip 8% on a Truth Social post or false headline,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna.\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nShow full article\nTrack\nLatest News\nLive on NDTV.com and get\nnews\nupdates from\nIndia\nand around the\nworld\nFollow us:\nStock Market",

            "summary": "Apr 07, 2025 16:29 pm IST\nOpinion | Upstarts Or Startups? Why Piyush Goyal Is Not Entirely Wrong\nCutting-edge entrepreneurship is more about adventurous ambition than just growth. There must be a passion for novelty, not mere get-rich-quick ideas.\nMadhavan Narayanan\nMadhavan Narayanan\nShare\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nReddit\nEmail\nIt is not a well-known yet an interesting fact that Vinod Khosla, often described as the hottest venture capitalist on the planet and a technology pioneer who was the founding CEO of Sun Microsystems, had relocated to Delhi, the city he grew up in, around the mid-1990s to be closer to his parents, not far from IIT Delhi where he studied. But the Internet opportunity that followed saw him move back to Silicon Valley, where he remains a cutting-edge figure in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), medical technology and cryptocurrency.\nMy days tracking and meeting the man who now runs Khosla Ventures after leaving Kleiner Perkins, the VC firm that funded companies like Amazon and Google, came to mind last week as I heard the timely but controversial statement by India's commerce and industry minister at the 'Startup Mahakumbh' jamboree. \"Are we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls... Is that the destiny of India? This is not a startup; this is entrepreneurship... What the other side is doing—robotics, machine learning, 3D manufacturing and next generation factories,\" Goyal said, showing a slide titled ‘India vs China. The Startup Reality Check'.\nAdvertisement - Scroll to continue\nWhat To Learn From Khosla\nThe word ‘startup' is often used loosely, but ideally should refer to technology-driven companies that can grow big through innovations. My view is that cutting-edge entrepreneurship is more about adventurous ambition than just growth. People like Khosla have a mental streak that shows passion for novelty, not mere get-rich-quick ideas. We need more like him.\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to be the entrepreneurial plumbers and builders of new technologies as such, but there is more to the future than that. When technology companies like Infosys were built in the 1980s and 1990s, the word ‘startup' was not even in vogue. But then, it became the first Indian company to list on the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange in 1999.\nA subsequent rush of VCs in India became less about technology and more about demographics. India's surging, increasingly affluent population and an Internet boom made VCs fuel a greed to build the so-called ‘unicorn' startups that commanded a valuation of a billion dollars or more - usually with an eye on IPOs.\nA 'This Of That' Culture\nWhat we had as a result was what tech investor Kashyap Deorah calls a \"this of that\" culture: Paytm became the PayPal of India, Flipkart was dubbed the Amazon of India, Swiggy and Zomato cloned Delivery Hero and Yelp with some tweaks. They mostly addressed a local market and built local brands, but not real intellectual property (IP) based on novelty on a global scale. That requires guts and an outlook of a different kind. Somewhere along the way, we started mistaking upstarts for startups. VCs and naive journalists fed into the hype.\nThe irony is that India has had real startups that are less celebrated. InMobi, a mobile ad platform that rivals Facebook-owner Meta, was hailed as India's first unicorn and is expected to have an IPO this year, nearly two decades into its existence. InMobi is the world's largest independent mobile ad network, engaging more than 750 million consumers across 165 countries. It is said to have turned down an acquisition offer from Google a decade ago.\nI-flex solutions, built in the 1990s, was acquired by Oracle for close to a billion dollars. It was a cutting-edge banking software company with a global footprint. Chennai-centred productivity software company Zoho competes with Microsoft.\nHowever, we are yet to produce a breathtaking product like Google. China is not quite there yet, either. But it is trying hard and big, as we have seen with the arrival of DeepSeek, a disruptive AI model.\nIndia has had a long, credible history of nurturing research through the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and other state-run bodies that set the base for cutting-edge innovation. Even ISRO and the Defence Research and Development Organisation have made quiet innovations. What we lack is new-age thinking by entrepreneurs that goes from ambition to adventure and closer innovation links with these establishments.\nWhen Steel Was Like AI\nLet's now raise a toast to the memory of Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata, who dared to think of making steel in the middle of a rural jungle in a colonially oppressed country in 1907. For the India of those times, steel was like AI. Verghese Kurien built Amul in rural Anand when the word ‘startup' did not exist in the Indian lexicon. The kind of adventurous streak shown in those ventures is something current entrepreneurs could learn from. Patience, patents, and perseverance separate the men from the boys and women from the girls in a true startup universe. Not scale, speed and salesmanship.\nBut it must be admitted that risk appetite requires context. You have to feel comfortable enough not to confuse a gamble with entrepreneurial chutzpah. We also need to cut down on a dubious culture of startup wannabes wanting corporate freebies from the government - from land to capital to subsidies.\nIt is worthwhile to point to less-known Indian companies like Hyderabad-based MOSChip Technologies, which has been in the field of semiconductors without being part of the VC-fuelled unicorn hype. Electric carmaker Reva, founded in Bangalore, is now part of the Mahindra group, and deserves praise for its early start and passion.\nA few listed small-cap companies fall in that league. Intellect Design Arena and Nucleus Software have built products and intellectual property, but perhaps have not taken the big bets needed to capture glamorous headlines. They were never called startups, but certainly were in the league when they started.\nLet Adventure Reign\nWhat I would like to see is some of India's 200-plus US dollar billionaires throwing a hundred million dollars each at a patent-seeking team of cutting-edge innovators based on deep research. They all may not succeed or grow very big, but some will. Even more important in the current context is a sense of adventure that people like Vinod Khosla, or rival Elon Musk, are famous for.\nFrom AI to quantum computing to genomics, opportunities for discovery and invention are different from those based on scale and speed. New discoveries are ushering in new opportunities. The minister's timing is just right. China's DeepSeek is best seen not as an inspiration but as a wake-up call. As a nation where Jawaharlal Nehru chose to nurture research and development amid and despite a colonially battered, impoverished state, we have no excuses.\n(Madhavan Narayanan is a senior editor, writer and columnist with more than 30 years of experience, having worked for Reuters, The Economic Times, Business Standard, and Hindustan Times after starting out in the Times of India Group.)\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author\nShare\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nReddit\nEmail\nSign up to read this\n                                 article FREE!\nExclusive Stories:\nDive into content reserved just for members.\nFewer Ads:\nA cleaner, more enjoyable reading experience.\nEnhanced Interface:\nTailored just for you.\nJoin Now – It’s Free!",

Sensex opened nearly 4,000 points lower, sliding over 3.5% since its last trading session, while Nifty tanked over 1,000 points this morning. The crash follows a massive sell-off in Asian equities, panicked by Trump's radical policies, and US futures pointing at significant losses when it resumes trading this evening. European markets too have slumped as panic selling continued.\nRead:\nMega Plunge In Asian Markets, US Futures Down In Big Trump Tariff Fallout\nThe tariffs - billed as the harbinger of a \"golden period\" for US industries - seek to undo trade practices that President Trump believes have been unfair. The tariffs are country-specific and go as high as 50%. The rate announced for India is 26%, which has set off fears among exporters and traders, in addition to a 10% baseline duty applied to all nations.\nA defiant Trump appeared unmoved by the bloodbath in global markets, equating his tariffs with a\nmedicine that is required to \"fix something\"\nwhile speaking to reporters this morning.\nIndian Equities Lose 3.5%\nSensex crashed 3, 939.68 points to 71,425.01 in early trade as trading resumed at 9 am after the weekend holidays. Nifty tumbled 1,160.8 points to 21,743.65 during this period. Sensex, a pack of India's top 30 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, was down over 3,000 points at noon, while Nifty, the National Stock Exchange index, dropped below the 22,000 mark.\nThe rupee also opened lower this morning, falling 30 paise to 85.74 against the US dollar.\nAnalysts suggest Trump's tariffs were bound to cause fears in Indian markets and that the country now needs financial reforms to protect its domestic economy from the global trade war.\nRead:\nSensex Crash Due To Trump Tariffs Wipes Out Rs 20 Lakh Crore Investor Wealth\n“India will face the heat, not due to domestic reasons, but as an interlinked chain in the global portfolio flows.

The US inflation numbers will be released along with the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes,\" Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said.\nEquity benchmarks slumped on Friday due to an across-the-board sell-off, tracking weak global markets amid growing global trade war fears.\nDomestically, the RBI will decide on interest rates.

A major trend reversal in global stock markets happened after President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd.\"\nThe reciprocal tariffs came much steeper-than-expected, he noted.\n\"The 10 per cent baseline tariff on all imports, the 25 per cent tariff on all automobile imports and steep reciprocal tariffs on most countries are expected to raise inflation in the US and there are concerns that the US economy might even slip into stagflation.
